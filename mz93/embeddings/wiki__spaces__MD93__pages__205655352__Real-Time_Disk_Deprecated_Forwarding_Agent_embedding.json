  "text": "The real-time Disk_Deprecated forwarding agent creates files on the local file system that contains the received data. The files are created when any of the batch closing criteria that are defined in the agent are fulfilled. You can also trigger the current batch to close from APL. A disk buffer, consisting of temporary files, is synchronized with the received data at periodic intervals. When any of the batch closing criteria is fulfilled, or if the workflow stops, the buffered data and the data in memory are written to the configured target path. If the EC is terminated while the workflow is running, the temporary files will remain on disk as \"orphans\". When the workflow is restarted the orphan files will be processed. You can optionally tag these files with a suffix.
