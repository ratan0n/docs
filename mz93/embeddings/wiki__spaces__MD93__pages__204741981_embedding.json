  "text": "The Pico Viewer displays a list of all Pico clients currently online in the system. Pico clients are grouped in pico-started instances. For instance, ec1 in the figure below is a pico-started instance. To open the Pico Viewer, click the Tools button in the upper left part of the Desktop window, and then select Pico Viewer from the menu. Open Pico Viewer Columns Description Columns Description Group / Instance Name of the group and pico instance. For each pico instance, they will be assigned to a default group for that particular pico instance. For example, any Desktop will be assigned to the Desktop group. For any ECs that are not assigned to an EC Group, they will be assigned into the Execution Contexts group by default. For more details about EC group and what it is used for, refer to EC Groups . Delete Open Allows the user to remove a pico instance from the system in case it is unreachable. The Platform does not automatically unregister such an instance since it is accepted that it can reside on an unreliable network. Secure Indicates if the Pico instance is SSL secured or not. Start Time The time the pico instance was started. Memory Used, available, and maximum memory on the hosting JVM. Response [ms] The time it took in milliseconds for the local Desktop to invoke a ping on the pico instance. Marked for Shutdown A warning sign in this column indicates that a pico instance is marked for shutdown, via the mzsh command pico , and should not be assigned workflows. This column is only applicable to ECs. For further information about the pico command, see pico . Tool-Tip Information Hover the mouse over any pico instances folder in the Group / Instance column to display information on the OS, JVMs, architecture, and processors on which it is running, as well as the username and services. Open The tooltip of a pico instance Hover the mouse over any pico instances folder in the Memory column to display detailed information on the memory usage of the hosting JVM.
