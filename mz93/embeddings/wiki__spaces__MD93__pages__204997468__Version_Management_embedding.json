  "text": "The user may save new versions of a workflow while they are running or scheduled. However, it is not advisable to update or save a new version of the workflow that is scheduled to run or execute soon. In such a case, the workflow is reloaded to the most recent version upon activation or when it has finished the current execution. If the most recent workflow version is invalid, the workflow will abort when trying to load that version. A real-time workflow does not usually fall back to scheduled mode and therefore will not automatically pick up changes made to the workflow. Some real-time agents can be modified while they are running but will not be saved. See Dynamic Update in Administration and Management .",
