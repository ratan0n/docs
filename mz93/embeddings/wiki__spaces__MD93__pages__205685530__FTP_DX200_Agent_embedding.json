  "text": "This section describes the FTP DX200 collection agent. This agent is for batch workflow configurations. Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with the: VDS device in a DX200 switch Standard FTP (RFC 959, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt ) SSH2 and SFTP ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-03 ) The FTP/DX200 collection agent collects data files from a DX200 network element, and inserts them into a workflow, by using the FTP or SFTP protocol. To do this, the agent: Reads the storage control file TTSCOFyy.IMG , that specifies what to collect. Registers every file that has been successfully collected in the transaction control file TTTCOFyy.IMG . Note! By default, the agent skips files if the sequential order has been lost, and files that have been overwritten (reaching FULL state before being set to OPEN state) are not collected. However, by adding the Execution Context properties mz.dx200.acceptsequentiallost and mz.dx200.acceptoverwritten to the <pico name> .conf file of the relevant EC, you can change this behavior. See the System Administration Guide for further information about these properties. The section contains the following subsections: FTP DX200 Agent Preparations FTP DX200 Agent Configuration FTP DX200 Agent Transaction Behavior FTP DX200 Agent Input/Output Data and MIM FTP DX200 Agent Events",
