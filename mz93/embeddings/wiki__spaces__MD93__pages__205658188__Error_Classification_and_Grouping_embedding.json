  "text": "Any UDRs can be associated with error codes. Error Codes are in an APL function that attaches the Error Code and optional message to the UDR to build an error case such as No_Match_cust_data: A_Number = 123456789. This allows grouping of UDRs with the same error code and/or error case into reprocessing groups to facilitate corrective action such as collection from ECS into a workflow including the use of the bulk-edit functionality. It is possible to associate a Reprocessing Group to an error code automatically when the UDR with the error code is sent to ECS. If not done automatically as described above, this assignment is done manually usually after the corrective action is taken so that the record can be processed to completion in a workflow.",
