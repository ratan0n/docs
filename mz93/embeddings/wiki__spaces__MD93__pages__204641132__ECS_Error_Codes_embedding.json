  "text": "ECS Error Codes can be specified in the ECS and associated with both UDRs and batches. A reprocessing group can also be assigned an Error Code, so that when an entity is inserted into the ECS it is automatically available for collection by the ECS Collection agent. There are two predefined Error Codes within the system, AGGR_UNMATCHED_UDR and DUPLICATE_UDR , which are automatically set by the Aggregation and Duplicate UDR Detection agents when the corresponding error condition is detected. All other Error Codes are defined by the user. Apart from being accessible in the ECS Inspector, the error codes are also used in the ECS Statistics, see ECS Statistics , and ECS Statistics Event . Note! Several Error Codes can be attached to the same UDR. This affects the ECS Statistics output. For further information, see Error Code Search in ECS Statistics . To create an Error Code, click the Error Codes button in the ECS Inspector. This displays the Error Codes dialog. Open Error Codes dialog Click Add to open the Add Error Codes dialog. This is where assignments of new Error Codes are made. Open Add Error Codes dialog Setting Description Setting Description Error Code Enter the Error Code to be attached to UDRs or batches. Description Enter a description of the error code. RP Group Enter a reprocessing group to assign the Error Code to. You can send optional information to the ECS from an Analysis or Aggregation agent, as long as an Error Code has been defined. To this Error Code, any information may be appended using APL. See the example below. Example - Error case appended using APL An Error Case can be appended using APL code. udrAddError( input, \"CALL ID ERROR\", \"The callId: \" + input.callId + \", Calling number: \" + input.anum ); In this example the \"CALL ID ERROR\" is defined in the Error Codes dialog. Note! To clear a UDR's errors, the udrClearErrors function should be used. For further information, see the example Reassigning to a Different Reprocessing Group, in ECS Collection Workflow (UDR) .",
