Supported Functions The TimesTen database can be used with: Audit Profile Database Bulk Lookup Functions (APL) Database Table Related Functions (APL) Event Notifications Prepared Statements (APL) Shared Table Profile SQL Collection/Forwarding Agents Task Workflows Agents (SQL) Note! When storing a date MIM value in TimesTen, do not use the DATE column type. Instead, use the TIMESTAMP type. Preparations The TimesTen Client must be installed on every host (Platform or Execution Context instance) that is connected to a TimesTen data source. Place the ttjdbc11.jar file in the $MZ_HOME/3pp directory . Setting Java library path to include TimesTen library. Include TimesTen library to Java library path vi $MZ_HOME/common/config/cell/default/master/cell.conf # Update existing property value as below java.library.path=\"$TIMESTEN_HOME/install/lib\" Topo activate changes. Topo activate mzsh topo activate --allow-disconnected Restart the Platform and ECs for the change to take effect. Additionally, the TIMESTEN_HOME variable in the shell from which you launch the Platform or Execution Context instance, should include the path to the TimesTen Client native library. Example - $TIMESTEN_HOME is set to the path where TimesTen is installed export TIMESTEN_HOME=/path/to/timesten_home Performance Tuning In order to use the direct driver, you must install TimesTen on the Execution Context hosts. By doing so you improve performance. To decrease re-connection overhead, database connections are saved in a connection pool. To configure the connection pool size, set the Execution Context property timesten.connectionpool.maxlimit in relevant <pico> .conf file. Example - Configuring the connection pool size for TimesTen $ mzsh topo set topo://container:<container>/pico:<pico name>/val:config.properties.timesten.connectionpool.maxlimit 45",
