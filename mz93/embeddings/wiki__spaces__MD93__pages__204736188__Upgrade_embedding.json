  "text": "This section contain separate instructions for a standard upgrade procedure and for a simplified upgrade. The Standard upgrade procedure should be used when it is required to minimize downtime during upgrade and to ensure that configurations, persisted data (in the file system or database), and system properties are properly migrated. The Standard upgrade procedure needs to be done step-wise via every minor and major. The Simplified Upgrade procedure should be used when this is not required, and you only wish to migrate configuration data. The Simplified upgrade procedure can be done over multiple majors and minors in one upgrade. Note! If you have workflow packages containing workflows using Web Services in your system, you need to follow the steps described in Workflow Packages Containing Web Services before the upgrade. Note! In MediationZone 8, Keystore-related fields in an agent configuration can be configured in the Workflow Table. However, in MediationZone 9, these settings are moved to the Security Profile configuration and the Workflow Table does not support configuring the Security Profile fields directly.
