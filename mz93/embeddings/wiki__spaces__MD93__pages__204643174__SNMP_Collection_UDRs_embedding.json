When an SNMP profile is saved, a UDR type is created to reflect the hierarchical structure of the loaded MIBs. These structures are populated by the SNMP Request agent from the SNMP responses it receives from requested network elements. Only fields that are selected in the agent configuration are populated. The generated hierarchical structure can be viewed in the UDR browser in a folder called snmp.
