  "text": "The FTPS forwarding agent sends files to a remote host by using the standard FTP (RFC 959) protocol. Files are created when a Begin Batch message is received and closed when an End Batch message is received. In addition, the agent offers the possibility to compress (gzip) the files. To ensure that downstream systems do not use the files until they are closed, they are maintained in a temporary directory on the remote host until the End Batch message is received. This behavior is also used for Cancel Batch messages. If a Cancel Batch is received, file creation is canceled. The FTPS forwarding agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments. The section contains the following subsections: FTPS Forwarding Agent Configuration FTPS Forwarding Agent Memory Management FTPS Forwarding Agent Events FTPS Forwarding Agent MultiForwardingUDR Input FTPS Forwarding Agent Transaction Behavior FTPS Forwarding Agent Input/Output Data and MIM",
