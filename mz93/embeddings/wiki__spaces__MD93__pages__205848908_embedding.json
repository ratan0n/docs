  "text": "MediationZone empowers organizations to liberate the value hidden in their usage information via a unique approach to managing data that supports multiple mission-critical aspects of their business. The system is designed in such a way that customers benefit from fewer integration points and flexible data management. MediationZone bridges components residing in any type of network architecture, providing comprehensive functionality that ensures systems can communicate with each other as effectively as possible. Information is created based on raw data distributed across any number of network elements and systems. Data streams are optimized and enriched, translating into reduced cost for hardware, software licenses and maintenance while providing new opportunities to differentiate and personalize services. MediationZone is designed for online and offline processing on one platform. File-based collection and processing is configured with the same graphical workflow technology that is used to create bidirectional real-time communication streams. Design and change in the system is achieved through configuration rather than hard-coding. An intuitive and powerful drag-and-drop management user interface covers all aspects of workflow life-cycle management. Once configured, workflows are automatically deployed on designated servers that are part of an installation and executed in accordance with defined scheduling criteria. High availability capabilities ensure that workflows are executed at all times. MediationZone Optimizes Data Streams Processing functions include analysis, filtering, cloning, splitting, routing, normalization, correlation/aggregation, de-duplication, validation, enrichment, and more. The standard agents can be configured to support operator-specific business logic without the need for customization of the standard product. Integration with external systems for data exchange is achieved with plug-ins, which implement the protocols to be used when communicating with other systems. A large number of protocols are supported off-the-shelf, both for interfacing as well as for secure and consistent operation. Support for additional protocols is added continuously as part of roadmap development as well as on an on-demand basis. MediationZone configuration and control logic is centrally managed while execution can be distributed to any number of nodes in a network. Hardware independence and distributed design ensures scalability with any combination of high-end servers and commodity hardware.",
