  "text": "Couchbase Software Couchbase Profiles You should now create two Couchbase Profiles in MediationZone; one for the static configurations in the Data Repository, and one for the runtime data in the Data Repository. In Desktop, open the Build screen, click on the New Configuration button, and select Couchbase Profile . The New configuration - Couchbase Profile opens. In this dialog you have three tabs; Connectivity , which contains settings for the connections between the buckets in the cluster(s), Management , which contains the user name, password, size, and monitoring settings for the bucket, and Advanced , which contains the advanced properties. Create one profile for the configurations bucket, where: The Bucket Name is config or something similar. If you have selected Couchbase Release 5.x - 7.x , set the Bucket User and User Password as a user who has access to the bucket and their password. If you have selected Couchbase Release 4.x , it is optional to set a Bucket Password . The Cluster Nodes section contains the IP-address/host name for each of the Couchbase nodes in the cluster. The user name and password for the administrator created during Initial Server setup are added in the Management tab. You can select the Monitoring checkbox if you want to use monitoring functions for detecting unresponsive nodes and performing failover. Open Couchbase Profile - Management tab This profile will create a bucket called config (or similar), which will be used for static data in the Data Repository, such as the different configurations. Create another profile for the usage bucket, where: The bucket name is bucket or something similar. If you have selected Couchbase Release 5.x - 7.x , set the Bucket User and User Password as a user who has access to the bucket and their password. If you have selected Couchbase Release 4.x , it is optional to set a Bucket Password . The Cluster Nodes section contains the IP-address/host name for each of the Couchbase nodes in the cluster. The user name and password for the administrator created during Initial Server setup are added in the Management tab. You can select the Monitoring checkbox if you want to use monitoring functions for detecting unresponding nodes and performing failover. This profile will create a usage bucket called bucket (or similar), which will be used for the runtime data in the Data Repository, i.e the actual usage of the subscribers. In each Execution Container, open the pcc.properties file, located in the MZ_HOME/etc directory, and enter the names of your newly created profiles in the following properties: mz.pcc.storage.couchbase.config.profile= mz.pcc.storage.couchbase.buckets.profile= Example - pcc.properties mz.pcc.storage.couchbase.config.profile=MyFolder.config mz.pcc.storage.couchbase.buckets.profile=MyFolder.bucket In the PCC Config Storage Properties group, ensure that the property mz.pcc.config.storage.class is set to com.digitalroute.pcc.storage.config.couchbase.CouchbaseConfigStorage . In the PCC Bucket Storage Properties group, ensure that the property mz.pcc.bucket.storage.class is set to com.digitalroute.pcc.buckets.storage.couchbase.CouchbaseBucketStorage. Save the pcc.properties file. In order for the ECs to be able to locate the pcc.properties file, you must set the Execution Context property mz.pcc.properties . $ mzsh topo set topo://container:<container>/pico:<pico>/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties <path> Example - Setting mz.pcc.properties $ mzsh topo set topo://container:exec1/pico:ec1/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties '${mz.home}/\"etc/pcc.properties\"' $ mzsh topo set topo://container:exec1/pico:ec2/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties '${mz.home}/\"etc/pcc.properties\"' Important! It is important that the pcc.properties property file is located in the stated directory in all Execution Containers. Restart the ECs.
