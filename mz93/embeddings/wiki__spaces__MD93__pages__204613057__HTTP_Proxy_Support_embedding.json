  "text": "MediationZone can be configured to route outgoing HTTP traffic through an HTTP proxy. This is commonly required in networking environments where the execution context has limited access to the internet. Proxy configuration has to be performed on each Execution Context (EC) that is required to route HTTP traffic through a proxy. Proxy support is available for: HTTP APL functions HTTP Batch agent GCP agents HTTP/2 Client agent Salesforce Streaming agent Web Services agents This page has the following sub-sections: 1 Configuring Proxy Support 2 Authenticating the Proxy 3 Example Configuration Configuring Proxy Support Standard Java system properties are used to configure MediationZone to route HTTP traffic through an HTTP proxy. These properties must be configured at the Execution Context (EC) level for all execution contexts. Refer to proxy properties here: Execution Context Properties . It is often necessary to provide a list of destinations that should not be routed through the proxy. This list can be configured using the proxy property http.nonProxyHosts . Note that this property, despite the name, applies to both http and https traffic. Authenticating the Proxy MediationZone supports basic authentication to HTTP proxy. The username and password are configured using system properties. Refer to the proxy properties here: Execution Context Properties . Example Configuration Here is an example of how to configure the system properties to use an HTTP Proxy. Use the following command to edit the system properties. mzsh topo open ec1 config { classpath {} jvmargs { args=[] maxMetaspace=[ \"-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=196M\" ] } properties { mz.webserver.xframeoptions=DENY pico.groups=\"\" ec.backlog.dir=\"/Users/mzadmin/mz9/mz9HttpProxy/tmp\" ec.webserver.port=9090 http.proxyHost=192.168.205.4 http.proxyPort=3128 https.proxyHost=192.168.205.4 https.proxyPort=3128 http.proxyUser=test http.proxyPassword=DR-4-D999C75BC7A3C4AF1B4DAA7F134EEED9 https.proxyUser=test https.proxyPassword=DR-4-D999C75BC7A3C4AF1B4DAA7F134EEED9 http.nonProxyHosts=\"localhost|*.foo.com\" jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes=\"\" jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=\"\" } vendor-jvmargs { hp {} sun {} } }",
