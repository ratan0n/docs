When right-click in the code area, a context-sensitive popup menu appears, enabling easy access to the most common actions you might want to perform.

Opens the UDR Internal Format Browser from which the UDR Fields may be inserted into the code area. MIM Assistance... Open the MIM Browser from which the available MIM Resources may be inserted into the code area. UDR Internal Format Browser You use the UDR Internal Format Browser to easily insert UDR Fields into the code area. It opens in a dialog box that overlaps over the Agent Configuration screen. Open UDR Internal Format Browser The layout of the UDR Internal Format Browser is presented in two main sections  on the left, there is the UDR Types list, and on the right, there are the UDR Fields that correspond to the selection. Select a UDR Type from the presented list. You can expand on the types by clicking on the arrow button to show an individual type. Additionally, you can use the Search field box to find a particular type. Buttons to Expand All or Collapse All list items are also available. When the UDR type is selected, proceed to the UDR Fields selection on the right. The shown results can be filtered using the following options: Option Description Option Description Show Optional Select this option to show optional UDR fields. Show Readable Select this option to show readable UDR fields. Datatype You can filter the datatypes by using this dropdown menu list. Enable this option and select an entry. The available options are the following: bigint , bigdec, bitset, boolean, byte, bytearray, char, date, double, float. int, ipaddress, list<any>, map<any, any>, long, short, string , and void . You can also use the filter input field to type in a string to search for a particular UDR field. Select the appropriate one from the list and press OK to confirm the selection. The other available dialog boxes are Cancel, Refresh, and Apply. MIM Browser You use the MIM Browser to easily insert MIMs into the code area. It opens in a dialog box that overlaps over the Agent Configuration screen. Open The MIM Browser It shows the available selection of MIM types under dropdown sections based on their type. You can optionally use the buttons available on the top bar to Expand All or Collapse All available items. Make your selection and press OK to confirm. You can also Close the MIM Browser by clicking on the button. APL Code Completion To make APL coding easier, the APL Code Completion feature helps you to find and add APL functions and their respective syntax. To access APL Code Completion, place the cursor where you want to add an APL function, press CTRL+SPACE and select the correct function. In order to reduce the number of hits, type the initial characters of the APL function. The characters to the left of the cursor will be used as a filter.
