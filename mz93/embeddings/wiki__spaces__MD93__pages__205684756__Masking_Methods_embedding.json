  "text": "In the Data Masking profile, you configure the masking method you want to use, which UDR types and fields you want to mask/unmask, and any masking method-specific settings. There are four different masking methods that you can use: Crypto, which is used for encrypting data with either AES-128 or AES-256. Can be used for both obscuring and unmasking data. Database Storage, which is used for storing masked and unmasked data in a database enabling the data to be unmasked at a later stage. Hash, which is used for obscuring data only. You will not be able to unmask data using this method. Hash/Database, which is a combination of the Database and Hash storage methods; generating the output data the same way as the Hash method, but also storing the data in a database to allow for unmasking the values. This section includes: Crypto Database Storage Hash Hash/Database",
