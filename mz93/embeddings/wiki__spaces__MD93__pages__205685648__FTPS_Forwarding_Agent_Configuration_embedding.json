  "text": "To open the FTPS forwarding agent configuration, click Build  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type , select Batch . Click Add agent and select the Forwarding tab in the Agent Selection dialog. Select the Ftps agent. Double-click the agent icon or right-click the icon and select Edit agent , to display the Agent Configuration dialog. Connection Tab Open The FTPS forwarding agent configuration - Connection tab For information of the settings in this tab, see the Connection Tab in section FTPS Collection Agent Configuration . Target Tab Open The FTPS forwarding agent configuration - Target tab Setting Description Setting Description Input Type The agent can act on Input Type bytearray or MultiForwardingUDR . By default, the agent expects bytarrays. If nothing else is stated, the documentation refers to bytearrays. For Input Type MultForwardingUDR , refer to FTPS Forwarding Agent MultiForwardingUDR Input for more information. Directory Enter the absolute path of the remote host's target directory of where you want to place the forwarded files. The path can also be specified relative to the home directory of the user's account. The files are temporarily stored in the automatically created subdirectory DR_TMP_DIR in the target directory. When an endBatch message is received, the files are moved from the subdirectory to the target directory. Create Directory Select this checkbox to create the directory, or the directory structure, of the path that you specify in the field Directory . Note! The directories are created when the workflow is executed. Compression Select the compression type to determine if the agent should compress the target files before storage or not: No Compression - The agent does not compress the files. Gzip - The agent compresses the files using gzip. Note! No extra extension is appended to the target filenames even if compression is selected. Produce Empty Files Select this checkbox if you need to create empty files. Handling of Already Existing File Select the behavior of the agent when the file already exists: Overwrite - The old file is overwritten and a warning is logged in the System Log. Add Suffix - If the file already exists, the suffix \".1\" is added. If this file also exists, the suffix \".2\" is added instead, and so on. Abort - Default. This is the option used for workflows from upgraded configurations / in an upgraded system. Use Temporary Directory If this option is selected, the agent moves the file to a temporary directory before moving it to the target directory. After the whole file has been transferred to the target directory, and the endBatch message has been received, the temporary file is removed from the temporary directory. Use Temporary File If there is no write access to the target directory and, hence, a temporary directory cannot be created, the agent can move the file to a temporary file that is stored directly in the target directory. After the whole file has been transferred, and the endBatch message has been received, the temporary file is renamed. The temporary filename is unique for every execution of the workflow. It consists of a workflow and agent ID, as well as a file number. Abort Handling Select how to handle the file in case of cancelBatch or rollback. Choose between Delete Temporary File or Leave Temporary File . Note! When a workflow aborts, the file is not removed until the next time the workflow is run. Advanced Tab Open The FTPS forwarding agent configuration - Advanced tab Setting Description Setting Description Command Port Enter the port number that the FTPS service should use to connect to the remote host. Timeout(s) Enter the maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the server. Zero (0) means wait forever. Passive Mode (PASV) This checkbox must be selected if FTPS passive mode is used for data connection. In passive mode, the channel for data transfer between client and server is initiated by the client instead of by the server. This is useful when a firewall is situated between the client and the server. Additional Hosts Select Add to enter additional hosts or IP addresses to access the target directory for file storage. If the agent fails to connect to the remote Host specified in the Connection tab, it tries to connect to the hosts listed here, in sequence from top to bottom. Use the Add , Edit , Remove , U p , and Down buttons to configure the host list. Note! Go to the Filename Template tab to configure what to name the created files. Go to the Thread Buffer tab to configure how to use private threads for an agent, to enable multi-threading within a workflow. For further information, see Workflow Template . Backlog Tab The Backlog tab contains configurations related to backlog functionality. Open The FTPS forwarding agent configuration - Backlog tab Setting Description Setting Description Enable Backlog Select this checkbox to enable backlog functionality. If Enable Backlog is cleared, files are moved directly to their final destination when an end batch message is received. If Enable Backlog is selected, files are first moved to a directory called DR_POSTPONED_MOVE_DIR and then to their final destination. Refer to the section Retrieves, in FTPS Forwarding Agent Transaction Behavior for more information about transaction behavior. When a backlog is initialized and when backlogged files are transferred, a note is registered in the System Log. Directory Enter the base directory into which the agent should create subdirectories to handle backlogged files. Absolute or relative path names can be used. Type Select Files to be able to enter the maximum number of files allowed in the backlog folder into the Size field. Selet Bytes to be able to enter the total sum (size) of the files that reside in the backlog folder. If a limit is exceeded the workflow aborts. Size Enter the maximum number of files or bytes that the backlog folder can contain. Processing Order Determine the order by which the backlogged data will be processed once connection is reestablished, select between First In First Out (FIFO) or Last In First Out (LIFO). Duplicate File Handling Select Abort or Overwrite to specify what should happen if a file with the same file name as the one being transferred is detected. This action will apply both when a file is transferred to the target directory and to the backlog.",
