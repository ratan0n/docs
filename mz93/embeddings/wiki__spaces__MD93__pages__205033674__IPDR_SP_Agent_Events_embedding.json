  "text": "Agent Message Events There are no agent message events for this agent. Debug Events Debug messages are dispatched in debug mode. During execution, the messages are displayed in the Workflow Monitor. You can configure Event Notifications that are triggered when a debug message is dispatched. For further information about the debug event type, see Debug Event . The agent produces the following debug events: IPDR/SP Common Configuration This message is displayed when the agent first starts up. There will be a series of properties accompanying this message, among those will be keep alive intervals and ACK time intervals. Template Negotiation Configuration This message is displayed when Template Negotiation is enabled for the agent. Additional messages will be displayed alongside this message depending on the fields chosen in the IPDR SP Template profile. Adding collector with connectionKey(<IP address;port;session) This message is displayed prior to the agent starting the connection process with the IPDR SP exporter. Trying TCP connection to <IP address:port> This message is displayed when the agent is attempting to establish a connection with the IPDR SP exporter. Starting IPDR/SP for collector <IP address;port;session> This message is displayed when the agent has successfully established a connection and started a session with the exporter Received Template definition ID = <template ID>, SN = <link to the appropriate DOCSIS Service Definition Schema Name> This message is displayed when the agent receives the template definition from the exporter. Checking Template for negotiation: SN = <link to the appropritate DOCSIS Service Definition Schema Name> This message is displayed when the agent decides to perform a check on the template definition received from the exporter. Any request to modify the template will be sent by the agent to the exporter after this. Mapping Template (final): SN = <link to the appropritate DOCSIS Service Definition Schema Name> This message is displayed when the agent performs the final mapping of the IPDR SP template after the template negotiations are done. Keepalive timeout - sending keepalive This message is displayed when the agent sends a periodic keepalive to the exporter. Stopping the agent... This message is displayed when the workflow is stopped. Cleaning up... This message is displayed just before the FLOW_STOP and DISCONNECT request is sent to the exporter. Removed collector with connectionKey (<IP address;port;session) This message is displayed when the workflow is stopped, just after cleaning up. Failed to connect to <IP address;port;session> after <count> tries. Giving up. This message is displayed when the agent has trouble establishing connection with the exporter.",
