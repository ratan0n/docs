  "text": "The main benefits with the vcexport / vcimport commands compared to the systemexport / systemimport commands are: The exported configurations are easier to read, which also makes it easier to compare the new export with any previous export. The format is more compact than the traditional export format. vcexport usage: vcexport [options] This command exports configurations in a format that is adapted for version control systems. The vcexport command exports the configurations into a flat structure, i e with file extensions instead of directories. For each exported configuration, a .xsd file will be generated in which the structure of the data is stored, which will produce a more compact format than the other export commands can offer. vcimport usage: vcimport [options] This command imports exports made with the vcexport command. Note! If a key or name conflict occur, the imported data will not overwrite existing configurations.",
