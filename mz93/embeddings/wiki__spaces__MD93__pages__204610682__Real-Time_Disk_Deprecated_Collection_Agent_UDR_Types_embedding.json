  "text": "This section describes the UDR types that are used with the Disk_Deprecated collection agent. FileBegin The FileBegin UDR type is used to indicate that collection of a file has begun. This UDR type does not contain any data from the collected file. Field Description Field Description FileName (string) This field contains the name of the processed UDR. IsRecovery (boolean) This field is set to true if the collected file was recovered from DR_TMP_DIR after a workflow restart. FileEnd The FileEnd UDR type is used to indicate that the Disk_Deprecated collection agent has routed the final or complete data set to the workflow. This UDR type does not contain any data from the collected file. When the workflow receives an FileEnd UDR type, it must acknowledge the reception by routing it back to the Disk_Deprecated collection agent. If the workflow fails to acknowledge the reception of the UDR within the time specified in Timeout (ms) , a timeout occurs. The collected file is then handled according to the Timeout Handling settings. Field Description Field Description RecordCount (int) This field contains the total number of partial data sets in the collected file. FileName (string) This field contains the name of the processed file. IsRecovery (boolean) This field is set to true if the collected file was recovered from DR_TMP_DIR after a workflow restart. FileError The FileError UDR type is used to indicate errors that occur during the collection of a file. If the agent fails to read, move, or decode the file, this UDR type is routed to the workflow. Field Description Field Description ErrorMessage (string) This field contains a description of the error. Filename (string) This field contains the name of the erroneous file. IsRecovery (boolean) This field is set to true if the collected file was recovered from DR_TMP_DIR after a workflow restart. FileSend The FileSend UDR type is used for routing data from the collected file to the workflow. Depending on the value of the Read Size (b) setting and the actual size of a collected file, the agent produces one or more UDRs that contain a partial or complete data set. Field Description Field Description Counter (int) This field contains a sequence number that identifies the partial data set in the collected file. Data (any) This field contains the output data (payload) from the agent. FileName (string) This field contains the name of the processed UDR. IsRecovery (boolean) This field is set to true if the collected file was recovered from DR_TMP_DIR after a workflow restart.",
