The interface consists of the following binaries: start_ftaminterface - Starts the interface. status_ftaminterface - Reports status of the interface. stop_ftaminterface - Terminates the interface. ftamagent - Internal communication agent. Open It is important to start the interface by using a full path name. If the binaries are placed in /opt/mz/ftam/bin the same path must be used when the interface is started. The following command can be used to start the interface: $ /opt/mz/ftam/bin/start_ftaminterface ROOT_DIR=/var/ftamroot PORT=16702 The port name mzftam not found in /etc/services, the default value 16702 will be used.

The binaries can be found in the installation package that you used to install MediationZone. They are located in: <release content directory>/release/complete/other/FTAM_LINUX_ISODE.tar. The release content directory will be where you have extracted your installation files from the tgz. Note! If you are using a 64-bit OS, you will be required to install the 32-bit versions of the OS system libraries. This is because the ftam binaries requires the 32-bit versions of the OS system libraries to be present. The root directory contains internal state information for recovery and log files.",
