  "text": "To open the ECS Statistics dialog, click the Inspection button in the upper left part of the Desktop window, and then double-click ECS Statistics in the menu. The system gathers the current number of New and Reprocessed UDRs and batches per Error Code from the ECS. The ECS Statistics window allows for inspection of these calculated values, as well as more specific views since the data may be inspected down to the Error Code level. The data may also be exported and printed. Note! The ECS Statistics data is gathered and calculated using a system task called ECS_Maintenance, see ECS Maintenance System Task for more information. If you want to change the scheduling of the task, this is done in the ECS_Maintenance_grp configuration. If the ECS_Maintenance system task is scheduled to be executed with a time interval of less than an hour, the statistical data will be gathered every hour. Initially, the ECS Statistics dialog is empty. It is populated by performing a search. Setting Description Setting Description Search Shows the Search ECS Statistics dialog. For further information, see the section below, Searching the ECS Statistics. Export Shows the Export dialog, allowing the statistics to be exported. Print Shows the Print dialog, allowing the statistics to be printed. Searching the ECS Statistics To populate the ECS Statistics window, click Search and specify the search criteria. If no limitations are entered in the Search ECS Statistics dialog, a basic search is performed. For further information, see the section below, Basic Search. Open Search ECS Statistics dialog Setting Description Setting Description Data Type Determines if the search is made for Batches or UDRs. Error Code A list of available Error Codes, as defined in the ECS. To search for more Error Codes, click the Add button below the Error Code list. Period Select Period to search for a specific time period when the data was entered into the ECS. Note! Only 100 000 entries at a time can be browsed. If the search results in more than 100 000 entries, bulk operations must be repeated for each multiple of 100 000. Basic Search If no limitations are entered in the Search ECS Statistics dialog, a basic search table is shown. Select one row in the table to display the spread of Error Codes into a pie chart. If up to four Error Code types for the same date are named, these are all shown in the graph. If five or more Error Code types are present, the three most common Error Code types are shown, and the rest are grouped into the Other category. Open ECS Statistics dialog - Search without limitations Item Description Item Description Date The date and time when the values were calculated. New The amount of new errors current in the ECS on the given date. Reprocessed The amount of reprocessed errors current in the ECS on the given date. Value Type Select to display statistics for either New or Reprocessed UDRs or batches. Error Code Search If a specific Error Code search is done, three new columns related to the Error Codes are added to the table. Open ECS Statistics dialog - Search of error codes Item Description Item Description Error Code The Error Code column is visible when the search is made based on Error Codes. It displays the error code name. Newest The last time the error occurred. Oldest The first time the error occurred. Error Code Report Shows the number of UDRs attached to the selected Error Code.",
