  "text": "A Base event is the parent of all events, except for the user defined events. Since it is the parent it means that all events will inherit the fields of the base event . Note! Subscribing to base events is not recommended since it will match every event produced in the system, which may generate a high volume of events. Base events contains the following information: category - Not utilized for Base event. contents - A hard coded string containing event specific information; the original event message. For instance, for the ECS Insert Event, this string will contain the type of data sent to ECS, the workflow name, the agent name, and the UDR count. For information about the contents field, see the specific event types (this table). eventName - The name of the Event, that is, any of the types described in this section, for example, Base event, Code Manager event or Alarm event. origin - The IP address of one of the following: Execution Context - On which the workflow that issues the event is running. Platform - If this is not a Workflow event. Desktop - If this is a User Event. receiveTimeStamp - The date and time for when an event is inserted in the platform database. For example, this is the time used in the System Log. severity - The severity of the event. May be any of: Information, Warning, Error or Disaster. The default value is Information. timeStamp - The date and time taken from the host where the event is issued.",
