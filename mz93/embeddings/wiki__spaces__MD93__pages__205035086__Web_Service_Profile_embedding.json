  "text": "The Web Services (WS) Profile enables a web service definition. A successfully created profile defines a given web service across the platform. It is used by specifying a WSDL file and/or XSD file or a zipped file of all related contents. The WS profile can include more than one WSDL file reference. The WS profile is loaded when you start a workflow that depends on it. Changes to the profile become effective when you restart the workflow. Saving a WS profile that is assigned with a WSDL file, maps data types that are specified in the WSDL Schema section as UDR types for the workflow.
