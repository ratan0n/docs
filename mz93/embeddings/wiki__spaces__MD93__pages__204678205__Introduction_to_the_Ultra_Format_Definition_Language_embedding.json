  "text": "Ultra Format Definition Language (UFDL) is the language used to configure the MediationZone format handling subsystem. It describes the physical structure of incoming and outgoing (external) data, internal (working) formats, as well as decoding and encoding rules. The agents responsible for translations are the Decoder and Encoder agents. The Decoder converts external raw data (byte arrays) into internal data (UDRs). The Encoder works the other way around, converting internal formats into raw output data for the forwarding agents. Open Decoders and Encoders processing data UFDL syntax is entered in the Ultra Format Configuration . This chapter includes the following sections: Building Blocks The Ultra Module",
