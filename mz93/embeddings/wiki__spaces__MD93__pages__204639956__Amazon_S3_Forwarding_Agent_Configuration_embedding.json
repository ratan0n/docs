  "text": "To open the Amazon S3 collection agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration, you can do the following: right-click the agent icon and select Configuration... select the agent icon and click the Edit button Note! If you are using the Amazon S3 collection agent in a Batch workflow, part of the configuration may be done in the Filename Template tab in Workflow Template . For Real-Time workflow, additional configurations in File Closing Criteria tab are available in Batch-Based Real-Time Agents - Agent Configuration . Open Amazon S3 forwarding agent configuration dialog - Amazon S3 tab Setting Description Setting Description Profile Select the File System profile you want the agent to use, see File System Profile for further information about this profile. Input Type The agent can act on two input types. Depending on which one the agent is configured to work with, the behavior will differ. The default input type is bytearray, that is the agent expects bytearrays. If nothing else is stated the documentation refer to input of bytearray. If the input type is MultForwardingUDR , the behavior is different. For further information about the agent's behavior in MultiForwardingUDR input, see Amazon S3 Forwarding MultiForwardingUDR Input . File Information Directory Enter the absolute pathname of the target directory on the location stated in the referenced File System profile, where the forwarded files will be stored. The files will be temporarily stored in the automatically created subdirectory DR_TMP_DIR , in the target directory. When an End Batch message is received, the files are moved from the subdirectory to the target directory. Create Directory Select this setting to create the directory, or the directory structure, of the path that you specify in the Directory field. Note! The directories are created when the workflow is executed. Compression Select the compression type of the target files: No Compression - agent does not compress the files. This is the default setting. Gzip - agent compresses the files using gzip. This determines if the agent will compress the files or not. Note! No extra extension will be appended to the target filenames, even if compression is selected. The configuration of the filenames is managed in the Filename Template tab only. After Treatment Command If a UNIX command is supplied, it will be executed on each successfully closed temporary file, using the parameter values declared in the Arguments field. Note! At this point the temporary file is created and closed, however the final filename has not yet been created. The entered command has to exist in the execution environment, either including an absolute path, or to be found in the PATH for the execution environment. Arguments This field is optional. Each entered parameter value has to be separated from the preceding value with a space. The temporary filename is inserted as the second last parameter, and the final filename is inserted as the last parameter, automatically. This means that if, for instance, no parameter is given in the field, the arguments will be as follows: $1=<temporary_filename> $2=<final_filename> If three parameters are given in the field Arguments, the arguments are set as: $1=<parameter_value_#1> $2=<parameter_value_#2> $3=<parameter_value_#3> $4=<temporary_filename> $5=<final_filename> Produce Empty Files If enabled, files will be produced although containing no data.",
