For examples and further information on writing code in the Python collection agent, see Python Writer's Guide . The following function blocks are supported by the Python collection agent: Function Block Description def initialize() This function block initializes resources and state. def execute() This function block is the main entry point for collection. def consume(input) This function block consumes and processes UDRs that are routed to the agent . def timeout(obj) This function block is called when using the setTimeout function. UDRs may be routed in a timeout function block. When possible, always route to an asynchronous route from the timeout function block. def stopInput() This function block is called when the workflow does not want the collector to produce any more data. def stop() This function block is called when the workflow is about to stop. def deinitialize() This function block will cleanup resources and state.",
