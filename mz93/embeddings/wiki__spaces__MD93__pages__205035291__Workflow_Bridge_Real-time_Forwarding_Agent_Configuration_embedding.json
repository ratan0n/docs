To open the Workflow Bridge processing agent configuration, click Build  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select a workflow type, select Realtime . Click Add agent and select Workflow bridge from the processing tab of the Agent Selection dialog. Open Workflow Bridge forwarding agent configuration dialog for a real-time workflow Setting Description Setting Description Profile This is the profile to use for communication between the workflows. For information about how to configure a Workflow Bridge profile, see Workflow Bridge Profile . All workflows in the same workflow configuration can use separate profiles. For this to work, the profile must be set to Default in the Workflow Table tab found in the Workflow Properties dialog. For further information on the Workflow Table tab, refer to Workflow Table . To select a profile, click on the Browse... button, select the profile to use, and then click OK . Stream ID Workflow Bridge collection and forwarding agents use Stream IDs to manage connections between multiple workflow instances. Instead of creating separate profiles for each pair of workflows, you can use a single profile and assign a Stream ID to ensure that the correct workflows are linked. This is particularly useful when scaling your system, as it allows new workflow instances to automatically find their corresponding counterparts. Example  Configuring a Stream ID in Workflow Bridge Collection and Forwarding Agents Scenario: You need to scale your system by adding multiple instances of connected workflows. Instead of manually configuring separate Workflow Bridge profiles for each instance, you can use Stream IDs to automatically pair workflows. For example, if three processing workflows (A, B, and C) need to send data to three corresponding collection workflows (X, Y, and Z), you can define stream IDs like \"A-X\", \"B-Y\", and \"C-Z\". This ensures each processing workflow sends data to the correct collection workflow while maintaining a simpler, more scalable configuration.",
