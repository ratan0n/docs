  "text": "A workflow is loaded and started on an EC group according to configured distribution criteria, for example, based on machine load or by specifying the EC groups where the workflow should run. You can create EC groups using the EC Groups tool in the Manage view. Create EC using pico management or via topo commands. Refer to Pico Management or Managing Picos with Topo for more information. Add ECs into the EC group using the topo command: mzsh topo set topo://container:<container name>/pico:<ec name>/val:config.properties.pico.groups \"<EC Group Name>\" Note! To run a workflow on a specific EC, an EC group needs to be created. Multiple ECs can be included in an EC group to serve a workflow. There are multiple ways of adding EC groups to the system. Refer to EC Groups for additional information. If only one EC is to be included in the EC Group, you may do the following or do as for multiple ECs: Create the EC group with the same name as the EC from the UI Restart EC If multiple ECs are to be included in one EC Group, you must: Add the property pico.groups to all ECs that should be included by using this command: mzsh topo set topo://container:main1/pico:ec1/val:config.properties.pico.groups \"myEcGroup\" Restart the ECs. Execution Tab in Batch Workflow The Execution tab has settings that are related to where the workflow will be executed and how often it will execute. Open The Batch Workflow Execution tab Item Description Item Description Execution Settings Select Enable to enable setup of the execution parameters. Distribution A workflow executes on an EC group. You can specify these EC groups, or the system can select them automatically. Note! EC groups will only be used if you have selected them, the reason for this is to avoid the execution of undesired workflows. The following options exist: Sequential - Starts the workflow on the first EC group in the list, if you choose the sequential option and only configure one EC group then the workflow will not run if the EC group is not available. If this EC group is not available, it proceeds with the next in line. Workflow Count - Starts the workflow on the EC group running with the fewest number of workflows. Machine Load - Starts the workflow on the EC group with the lowest machine load. Round Robin - Starts the workflow on the available EC groups in turn, but not necessarily in a sequential order. If ecg1, ecg2 and ecg3 are defined, the workflow may first attempt to start on ecg2. The next time it may start on ecg3 and then finally on ecg1. This order is then repeated. If an EC group is not available, the workflow will be started on any of the other listed EC groups. Kafka Profile Required to enable the Kafka-based batch transaction handler for https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/GADzEQ . This setting must be selected to use Kafka agents in batch workflows. When selected, MediationZone uses the Kafka cluster identified by this profile for all Kafka agents in the workflow. It also uses a Kafka-based transaction handler to ensure batch transactions across all Kafka agents in the workflow. Debug Type Select Event to enable debug output, such as output from a debug call in the APL code, to appear in the Workflow Monitor . Select File to save debug results in $MZ_HOME/tmp/debug . The file name is made up of the names of the workflow template and of the workflow itself, for example: MZ_HOME/tmp/debug/Default.radius_wf.workflow_2 . Only debug events are written to the file. To save to file all the events that are shown when you select to monitor events in the Workflow Monitor, you must add an event notifier to the relevant Agent Message Event with file output. For further information, see Event Notifications . If you save debug results in a file, and you restart the workflow, this file gets overwritten by the debug information that is generated by the second execution. To avoid losing debug data of earlier executions, set Number of Files to Keep to a number that is higher than 0 (zero). Number of Files to Keep : Enter the number of debug output files that you want to save. When this limit is reached, the oldest file is overwritten. If you set this limit to 0 (zero), the log file is overwritten every time the workflow starts. Example - Debug output The workflow configuration Default.radius_wf includes a workflow that is called workflow_2. Number of Files to Keep is set to 10. The debug output folder contains the following files: Default.radius_wf.workflow_2 (current debug file) Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.1 (newest rotated file) Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.2 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.3 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.4 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.5 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.6 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.7 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.8 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.9 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.10 (oldest rotated file) According to this example there are totally 11 files that are being overwritten one-by-one and the rotation order is: Default.radius_wf.workflow_2 | V Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.1 | V Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.2 | V : : | V Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.n | V Deleted Example - Using the option Always Create a New Log File If you have a workflow named Default.radius_wf with an instance called workflow_2 and you create new debug output files every time the workflow executes, the debug output folder contains files like the following: Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.1279102896375 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.1279102902908 Default.radius_wf.workflow_2.1279102907149 Caution! The system will not manage the debug output files when this option is used. It is up to the user to make sure that the disk does not fill up. Throughput Calculation MediationZone contains an algorithm to calculate the throughput of a running workflow. It locates the first agent in the workflow configuration that delivers UDRs, usually the decoder and counts the number of passed UDRs per second. If no UDRs are passing through the workflow, the first agent delivering raw data will be used. The statistics can be viewed in the System Statistics . If a MIM value other than the default is preferred for calculating the throughput, the User Defined check box is selected. From the browser button, a MIM Browser dialog is opened and available MIM values for the workflow configuration is shown and a new calculation point can be selected. Since the MIM value shall represent the amount of data entered into the workflow since the start (for batch workflows from the start of the current transaction), the MIM value must be of a dynamic numeric type, as it will change as the workflow is running. Execution Tab in Real-Time Workflow Open The Realtime Execution tab Item Description Item Description Execution Settings Select Enable to enable setup of the execution parameters. Distribution A workflow executes on an EC group. You can specify these EC groups, or the system can select them automatically. Note! If you select to configure the distribution using EC groups, the selected distribution type will also be applied on the ECs within the groups. The following options exist: Sequential - Starts the workflow on the first EC group in the list. If this EC group is not available, it proceeds with the next in line. Workflow Count - Starts the workflow on the EC group running the fewest number of workflows. If the Execution Contexts list contains at least one entry, only this/these EC groups will be considered. Machine Load - Starts the workflow on the EC group with the lowest machine load. If the Execution Contexts list contains at least one entry, only this/these EC groups will be considered. Which EC group to select is based on information from the System Statistics sub-system. Round Robin - Starts the workflow on the available EC groups in turn, but not necessarily in a sequential order. If ecg1, ecg2 and ecg3 are defined, the workflow may first attempt to start on ecg2. The next time it may start on ecg3 and then finally on ecg1. This order is then repeated. If an EC group is not available, the workflow will be started on any other available EC groups. Execution Context Type Select an execution context type that the workflow should execute on. The following options exist: Normal - This setting enables execution of the workflow on one or more ECs. If several ECs/EC groups are added to the Execution Contexts list, the selected Distribution is considered. If no EC/EC group is selected the system will consider all available ECs as possible targets. Standalone - This setting enables execution of a stand-alone workflow that is independent of the Platform. To add an EC group, click Add and select an EC Group in the drop-down list. Queue Size The number of unprocessed entries (backlog) that the workflow can store in a buffer before the collector is slowed down. The workflow and its back-end systems might slow its processing activity when the number of requests rises. To avoid congestion, while the records or decoding tasks are in the queue, the queue intake is delayed to limit the backlog from growing too fast. Default value is 1000. The value that you enter here is the size of each route's queue in the workflow. Queue Strategy Blocking queue This is the default method. Ordered Routing To be able to preserve the order of incoming UDRs, this option should be used in combination with Ordered Services in the Service tab. Open To maintain the order of the UDRs as the agent sees it from the source, you can use the function ordered routing. This ensures that you retain the routing order, even if the work is divided over several threads. When using this function you must define how to catch the order of the UDRs. This can be done with APL in the Services tab in Workflow Properties. Via the 'input' value, typically by instanceOf checks for each routed type, Use ordered.addInteger(si, i) etc with values from session defining fields. Hashing will select partition. Alternatively use ordered.setPartition(si, N) to explicitly chose a partition. void route(order.SessionIdentifier si, any input) {....} Queue Worker Strategy By selecting Queue Worker Strategy , you can determine how the workflow should handle queue selection, which may be useful if you have several different collectors. You have the following options: RoundRobin The RoundRobin strategy works in the same way as the InsertionOrder strategy, except that each workflow thread will be given its own starting position in the routing queue list. This means that as long as the number of workflow threads is equal to, or greater than, the number of routing queues, no queue will suffer from starvation. Faster routes will get more load than slower ones. This option provides pretty fair distribution. Use this strategy if the number of workflow threads is equal to, or greater than, the number of routing queues, and it is desirable to prioritize faster routes before slower ones. RoundRobin is the default strategy. DedicatedAndRoundRobin In the DedicatedAndRoundRobin strategy, each queue has one thread dedicated to it by default. The number of workflow threads (given in the Threads column) minus one, serve the queues in round robin fashion. The number of threads indicates the maximum number of threads that can collect from a queue at any one time. One workflow thread guarantees the order of the UDRs in the workflow. InsertionOrder With the InsertionOrder strategy, queues are selected in route insertion order. As long as there are queued UDRs available on the first queue, that queue will be polled. This means that routes with later insertion order may not receive as many UDRs as they have capacity for, and get no or little throughput. This type of condition may be detected by looking at the Queue Throughput for workflows in the System Statistics view. Only use this strategy, if this is not an issue. This is the preferred choice when you work synchronously with responses and process small amounts of UDRs at any given time (which is not the same as low throughput). Note! The insertion order depends primarily on how close the queues are to an \"exit\", i e an agent without any configured output. The queues that are closest to an exit will be inserted first. The queues that are furthest from an exit, will be inserted last. However, if the distance to an exit is equal for two or more queues, the insertion order is dictated by the sequence of the agents in the workflow configuration, i e the agent that was added first to the configuration has higher priority. Threads The number of workflow threads. The default value is 8. Throughput Calculation MediationZone contains an algorithm to calculate the throughput of a running workflow. It locates the first agent in the workflow configuration that delivers UDRs, usually the decoder and counts the number of passed UDRs per second. If no UDRs are passing through the workflow, the first agent delivering raw data will be used. The statistics can be viewed in the System Statistics .

Since the MIM value shall represent the amount of data entered into the workflow since the start (for batch workflows from the start of the current transaction) the MIM value must be of a dynamic numeric type, as it will change as the workflow is running. Processed UDRs Count Interval (min) Select this option to specify the interval period in minutes for counting the number of processed UDRs. The default value is 1. The maximum value permitted is 1440 min (one day).",
