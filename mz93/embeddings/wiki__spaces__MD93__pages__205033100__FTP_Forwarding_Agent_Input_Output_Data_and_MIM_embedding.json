  "text": "Input/Output Data The agent consumes bytearray or MultiForwardingUDR types. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes MIM Parameter Description MultiForwardingUDR's FNTUDR This MIM parameter is only set when the agent expects input of MultiForwardingUDR type. The MIM value is a string representing the sub path from the output root directory on the target file system. The path is specified by the fntSpecification field of the last received MultiForwardingUDR . For further information on using input of MultiForwardingUDR type, refer to FTP Forwarding Agent MultiForwardingUDR Input . This parameter is of the string type and is defined as a batch MIM context type. File Transfer Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the target file is created in the temporary directory. File Transfer Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a trailer MIM context type. Target Filename This MIM parameter contains the target filename, as defined in Filename Template. Target Filename is of the string type and is defined as a trailer MIM context type. Target File Size This MIM parameter provides the size of the file that has been written. The file is located on the server. Target File Size is of the long type and is defined as a trailer MIM context type. Target Hostname This MIM parameter contains the name of the target host, as defined in the Target or Advanced tab of the agent. Target Hostname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Target Pathname This MIM parameter contains the path to the target file, as defined in the FTP tab of the agent. Target Pathname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Target Username This MIM parameter contains the login name of the user connecting to the remote host, as defined in the FTP tab of the agent. Target Username is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Accesses Various resources from the Filename Template configuration to construct the target filename.",
