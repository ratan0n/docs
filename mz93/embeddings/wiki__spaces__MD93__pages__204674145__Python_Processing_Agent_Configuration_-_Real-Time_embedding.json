General Tab The General tab consists of three sections: Python code for the consume block, input/output UDR types, and Interpreter configuration. Open The Python processing agent configuration - General tab Setting Description Setting Description Code Area This is the text area where you enter your code, see Python Writer's Guide for further information. The entered code will be color-coded depending on the code type, and for input assistance, a pop-up menu is available. Below the text area, there are line, column, and position indicators. See Python Code Editor Assistance . Input Types Enables selection of UDR Types. One or several UDR Types that the agent expects to receive may be selected. Set To Input Automatically selects the UDR Type distributed by the previous agent. Output Types Select which output types you want to have. Output Routes Enter the routes you want each output type to be sent out on. Interpreter select which Python Interpreter Profile you want to use. If no selection is made the interpreter that has been set as default in the Python Manager will be used. MIM Tab In the MIM tab, you can set the MIMs that you want the Python processing agent to publish.
