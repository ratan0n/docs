  "text": "usage: wfgroupaddwfgroup <workflow group name> <pattern match expression for workflow names> This command adds one or more workflow groups to an existing workflow group. Note! A workflow group that is already a member of the workflow group is skipped by the command. Similarly, you can not add a workflow group to itself. Example - Adding all the workflow groups with names beginning with wf_grp_, but skips wf_grp_1 mzsh <username>/<password> wfgoupaddwfgroup <wf_grp_1> <wf_grp_*> With this command, you compare a single pattern match expression, or several, with the full workflow group name, <folder>.<workflowgroupconfigurationname>.<workflowgroupname> , of all the workflows. For further information about pattern match expressions see Textual Pattern Matches . Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the wfgroupaddwfgroup command: Code Description 0 Will be returned if the command was successful. 1 Will be returned if the number of arguments is incorrect. 2 Will be returned if the group is not found. 3 Will be returned if the workflow(s) cannot be found. 4 Will be returned if there is no connection to Mgmt_Utils. 5 Will be returned if the group is locked. 6 Will be returned if the updating of group data failed. 7 Will be returned if the workflow type is not supported. 8 Will be returned if the configuration lock could not be released.",
