  "text": "The Database forwarding agent inserts UDR data into a database table, based on user-defined mappings between UDR fields and database table columns. Also, the agent offers the possibility of populating columns with other types of data. The data is inserted either using a plain SQL statement or through a call to a stored procedure that will be responsible for inserting the data. The agent does not only map and forward the data. A special column in the target table is also assigned a unique Transaction ID, generated for each batch. In relation to this, a pending transaction table is utilized to indicate that a batch is open. The Database collection agent also utilizes this table to prevent problems if collecting data from the target table. The section contains the following subsections: Database Forwarding Agent Configuration Database Forwarding Agent Input/Output Data and MIM Database Forwarding Agent Events Database Forwarding Agent Transaction Behavior",
