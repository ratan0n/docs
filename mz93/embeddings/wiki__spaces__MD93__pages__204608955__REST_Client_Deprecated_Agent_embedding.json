  "text": "The REST Client_Deprecated processing agent allows querying of any HTTP API using any of the methods specified in RFC 2616 ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.1 ). The agent expects RESTCycleUDR types, which contain both request and response fields. The request fields of the UDR include the header, method, body, and target resource URI. After performing an HTTP query, the agent routes a RESTCycleUDR type that includes the original request as well as the response from the server.
