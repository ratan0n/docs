  "text": "This section describes the Inter Workflow agents. The agents are used for temporary storage of stream data, merging stream data, and as gateways between real-time and batch workflows. Both agents are available in batch and real-time workflow configurations. The Inter Workflow agents allow files to be distributed between workflows within the same system. It is especially useful when transferring data from real-time workflows to batch workflows. The Inter Workflow agents use an Inter Workflow storage server to manage the actual data storage. The storage server can either run on an EC or on the Platform. The storage server and base directory to use are configured in an Inter Workflow profile. Open The Inter Workflow agents distribute files from one workflow to another Several forwarding workflows may be configured to distribute batches to the same profile, however, only one collection workflow at a time can be activated to collect from it. The Inter Workflow agents support IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Inter Workflow-Related UDR Type The UDR type created by default in the Inter Workflow agent can be viewed in the UDR Internal Format Browser in the InterWorkflow folder.
