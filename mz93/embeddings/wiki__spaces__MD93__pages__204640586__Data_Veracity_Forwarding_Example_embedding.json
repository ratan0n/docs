Example Workflow and Data: DV_Forwarding_Example.zip In this workflow example for the Data Veracity Forwarding agent Data Veracity Forwarding workflow example The workflow will collect an input file, decode it and then send it forward into the Analysis_1 agent. The Data Veracity Forwarding agent then receives the erroneous UDR (TT UDR in the example) from the Analysis agent. The Analysis agent contains the following code: Analysis_1 int i = 0; consume { i = i +1; if (i < 20){ udrAddError(input, \"my_error_code\", \"error occured\"); }else{ udrAddError(input, \"my_second_error_code\", \"error occured\"); } udrRoute(input); } Should there be any existing error code associated to a particular UDR, any new error code added to the UDR will be included along with the existing code. However, the first error code associated with the UDR will be the one to be displayed on the Data Veracity Search result. To clear any existing error code, you can use the udrClearError plugin. With this code, the Analysis agent will: Send 20 UDRs to Data Veracity with the error code my_error_code while using the APL plugin, udrAddError. Send subsequent UDRs will be sent to Data Veracity with the error code my_second_error_code",
