The main differences are that the new agents: Include a batch forwarding agent. Store transactions in the Kafka cluster (transactions are only tracked for batch workflows). Store offset in the Kafka cluster only. Enables one consumer to collect from several topics, and one producer to forward to several topics. Include automatic rebalancing for the collection of messages and several workflows can collect messages in parallel from the same topics will keep batch collection workflows in a running state, even when all data has been collected. Use only two UDR types: For more information, see New Kafka Agents . Amazon S3 Agents in Real-Time Workflows Ref: XE-13151, XE-13152 The Amazon S3 collection and forwarding agents can be used for collecting and forwarding files from and to specified buckets and regions in Amazon and they are now also available for real-time workflows. For more information, see Amazon S3 Agents . Amazon SQS Agents Ref : XE-13403 The Amazon SQS Agents act as consumers (collection agents) and producers (forwarding agents) of messages in Amazon Simple Queue Service, which is a fully managed message queueing service. Both standard and FIFO queueing are supported, see SQS Agents for more information. APN Processing Agent Ref: XE-14066 The APN processing agent is now available for real-time workflows. It enables push notifications to be sent to mobile devices using Apple certificates. The APN processing agent includes two distinct UDRs: one for pushing notifications and another for reporting results. For more information, see APN Agent . SAP CC REST Agent Ref: XE-11292 SAP CC REST agent allows you to connect and send charging requests to SAP Convergent Charging on SAP Cloud (RISE). The agent will use API to communicate with the SAP CC server, sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses in return. SAP CC REST agent has its own UDRs separate from other SAP CC agents and it is generated based on YAML files of the REST API version used by the SAP CC server. For more information, see SAP CC REST Agent . MariaDB Supported Agents for MariaDB Ref: XE-13414 MariaDB can now be used with the SQL Collection and Forwarding agents, the SQL Loader agent, and the Task Workflow SQL agent. For more information, see MariaDB . Additional APL Functions and Event Notifications Support MariaDB Ref: XE-13415 You can now select MariaDB when configuring to run the Callable Statements, Database Bulk Lookup Functions, Database Table Related Functions, Event Notifications, and Prepared Statements. For more information, see MariaDB . Usability New Command Line Interface Ref: XE-15667 We have created a new Command Line Interface called mzcli. It does not require connectivity to the platform to execute. See the Command Line Tool Reference Guide for more information. Desktop Search Ref: XE-13735 You can now search for configurations, APL codes, and Ultra formats using the search bar at the top of the Desktop. You can even use the search bar to create new configurations or to search for tools and Data Management applications. For more information, see Search . Log Filter Ref: XE-12917 You can now update the logging settings for picos dynamically, either in the Log Filter in Desktop Online or using mzsh. You can update log level, select to include stacktrace or not, perform logging for a selected package or class, add logging to an additional file and reset to default settings. For more information, see Log Filter and logger . Support for wfexport and wfimport mzsh Commands Ref: XE-13234 The wfexport command generates a file (CSV, TSV, or SSV) containing data from the Workflow Table. This file includes a header row listing the names of the Workflow Table columns. The wfimport command updates the specified workflow configuration by importing workflows defined in the export file. For more information, see wfexport and wfimport . MZSH Command For Shutting Down Desktop and Legacy Desktop Ref: XE-11515 With the, mzsh desktopadmin command you can shut down all Deskops and Legacy Desktops connected to the Platform, see desktopadmin . Integration and Security User Security Improvements Ref : XE-12201 Enhanced user security is now enabled by default upon installation of the Platform. The property mz.security.user.control.enabled is now set to true in the platform.conf file. Furthermore, the enhanced user security property mz.security.user.password.reset.enabled has been removed. With the property removed, by default, any users registered into the system will now be prompted to change their password on their first login. For more information, see Enhanced User Security . SAP CTS+ Integration Ref: XE-13755 SAP CTS+ (Change and Transport System) can now be integrated with MediationZone. It enables you to manage and transport configurations across different environments with greater flexibility and control. For more information see, SAP CTS+ Integration User's Guide . Google Secret Manager Ref: XE-14275 You can use the Google Secret Manager profile to setup up access credentials and properties for connecting to a Google Secret Manager environment. For more information, see Google Secret Manager Profile . Reference Data Management Supports SAP HANA Ref: XE-13153 The Reference Data profile allows you to select which tables are available for querying and editing through the Reference Data Management dashboard via the RESTful interface. You can now select SAP Hana in the Reference Data profile configuration. For more information, see Reference Data Profile . System Statistics Ref: XE-13313 System Statistics can now be viewed from the Desktop. You can access the System Statistics from the Tools and Monitoring section of the Manage View. For more information, see System Statistics . Enhancements followRedirects Field for RequestCycle UDR in HTTP/2 Agents Ref: XE-14079 To accommodate scenarios where a cookie may be included in the 3xx response message, the followRedirects field is introduced in the HTTP/2 RequestCycle UDR to disable automatic redirection if necessary. For more information, see HTTP/2 UDRs . HTTP/2 Client Agent Support Additional OAuth Settings Ref: XE-14080 The following fields have been added to OAuth 2.0 authentication type in HTTP/2 Client agent - Authentication tab: Client Auth Type : Added options for client_secret_basic and client_secret_post Base URL : This field is added to manage base URL settings For more information, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD93/pages/204739302 . Operations REST Interface for Host and Pico Ref: XE-13029 The Operations REST API is now available for host and pico. Users can access http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/host/v1/api-docs for host and http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/pico/v1/api-docs for pico on any given running system Platform. For more information, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD93/pages/205031043 . SAP RFC Processor Agent Supports Execution Time Threshold Configuration Ref: XE-14268 Two additional options; the Enable Logging for Execution Exceeding Time Threshold checkbox and Execution Threshold Time (min) field are added to the SAP RFC Processor agent configuration to allow users to configure the execution time threshold. When an RFC Function takes too long, any attempt to abort the workflow will be logged in the System Log. See https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD93/pages/205034531 for more information. Configurable Maximum Response Size for HTTP/2 Client Ref: XE-13740 Users can now set a maximum size limit for responses received by the HTTP/2 Client. To configure the maximum response size, use the Max Response Content Length field introduced in the Client tab of HTTP/2 Client agent configuration. See https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD93/pages/204739302 for more information. Data Type Conversion Property for SAP JCo ABAP Type P Ref: XE-14878 A new property is introduced to define the data type used for converting values when mapping to SAP JCo ABAP Type P (Binary Coded Decimal). The saprfc.bcd.double property provides flexibility to users in handling data types. See Execution Container Properties for more information. Database Sizing Ref: XE-17321 We have provided documentation on approach to plan for database sizing. Rollback In previous versions, rollback has not been available, but in this version rollback in case of failed upgrade has been implemented, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MD94/pages/399147509 .",
