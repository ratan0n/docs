  "text": "The Distributed Storage profile enables you to access a distributed storage solution from APL without having to provide details about its type or implementation. The use of the Distributed Storage profile and profiles for specific distributed storage types, such as Couchbase and Redis, makes it easy to change the database setup with a minimum impact on the configured business logic. This simplifies the process of creating flexible real-time solutions with high availability a nd perform ance. Note! If you switch between selecting Couchbase and Redis, the Distributed Storage iterator functions differ. For Couchbase you use dsCreateKeyIterator , and for Redis you use dsCreateREKeyIterator . For further information, see Distributed Storage Functions in the APL Reference Guide . Open Distributed Storage profile concept APL provides functions to read, store and remove data in one or multiple distributed storage instances within the same workflow. It also provides functions for transaction management and bulk processing. For information about which APL functions are applicable to the Distributed Storage profile, see the APL Reference Guide . The Couchbase and Redis profiles are available for use with the Distributed Storage profile . For further information about these profiles, see Couchbase Profile and Redis Profile . The Distributed Storage profile is loaded when you start a workflow that depends on it. Changes to the profile become effective when you restart the workflow. Configuration To create a new Distributed Storage profile configuration, click the New Configuration button in the upper left part of in Build View , and then select Distributed Storage Profile from the menu. The contents of the menus in the menu bar may change depending on which configuration type has been opened in the currently displayed tab. The Distributed Storage profile uses the standard menu items and buttons that are visible for all configurations, and these are described in Common Configuration Buttons . Open The Distributed Storage profile dialog Setting Description Setting Description Storage Type Select a storage type from the drop-down list. Profile Select the storage profile that you want to apply.",
