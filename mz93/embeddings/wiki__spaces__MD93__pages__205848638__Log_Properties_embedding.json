  "text": "This section describes the log related properties that you can set in the STR and the Desktop. All Pico Types These properties are applicable to all pico types in the STR. Property Description Property Description pico.logdateformat Default value: \"YYYY-MM-DD\" This property specifies the date format to be used in the log files. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html for further information. pico.log.header Default value: \" \" This property enables the addition of a header to the log file generated, which indicates which pico, and in which version of MediationZone the log file is generated. To add headers to the log of the pico in which you set this property, set this property to mz.version-pico . After setting this property you must restart the relevant pico. pico.log.level Default value: \"WARNING\" This property specifies the log level. The available values for pico.log.level are: ALL FINEST FINER FINE INFO WARNING SEVERE OFF Note! Changing the default log level to INFO, FINE, FINER, FINEST, or ALL, may have a significant impact on performance. pico.pid Default value: $MZ_HOME/log This property specifies the directory you want the EC or Platform to write process ID (PID) file to. If this property is not included in the pico configuration, the default directory, $MZ_HOME/log will be used. Note! If using several ECs, a directory has to be added for each EC. pico.stderr Default value: $MZ_HOME/log This property specifies the directory you want the EC or Platform to write standard errors to. If this property is not included in the pico configuration, the default directory, $MZ_HOME/log will be used. Note! If using several ECs, a directory has to be added for each EC. pico.stdout Default value: $MZ_HOME/log This property specifies the directory you want the EC or Platform to write standard output to. If this property is not included in the pico configuration, the default directory, $MZ_HOME/log will be used. Note! If using several ECs, a directory has to be added for each EC. log4j.configurationFile Default value: $MZ_HOME/etc/log4j2.xml This property specifies the location of log4j2 configuration file. If this property is not included in the pico configuration, the default directory, $MZ_HOME/etc/log4j2.xml will be used. Note! If using several ECs, a directory has to be added for each EC. log4j APL Logs - Platform The Platform property mz.logging.refreshinterval defines how often log4j APL logs are updated. It is set to 1000 ms by default. For further information about log4j APL logs, see log4j APL Logging Configurations .",
