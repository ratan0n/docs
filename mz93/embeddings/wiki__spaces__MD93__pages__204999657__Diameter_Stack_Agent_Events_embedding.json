  "text": "When you run a Diameter workflow, the peer connections of the Diameter Stack agents are monitored through the standard Diameter watchdog as described in RFC 6733 and RFC 3539. Possible states of the connection are: OKAY, SUSPECT, DOWN, REOPEN, and INITIAL. The Diameter peer state changed event is triggered whenever there is a change of peer state. You can configure an event notification that is triggered whenever a state change occurs. For more information about this event, see the section Diameter Peer State Changed Event . Diameter Dynamic Event You can configure an event notification that is triggered in the following cases when dynamic peer discovery is enabled: A Diameter workflow is started. The routing table of a Diameter Stack agent is dynamically updated. The TTL (time to live) of a cached DNS record expires. For more information about this event, see Diameter Dynamic Event . Agent Message Events An information message from the agent, is generated according to the configuration in the Event Notification Editor. For further information about the agent message event type, see Agent Event . Generic Diameter Server initialized for realm XXXX The message is generated when the workflow is started. RFC 6733 compliance warning: Passive mode enabled The message is generated if the workflow is started with the agent in the passive mode. Generic Diameter Server stopping. The message is generated when the workflow is stopping. Debug Events Debug messages are dispatched in debug mode. During execution, the messages are displayed in the Workflow Monitor. You can configure Event Notifications that are triggered when a debug message is dispatched. For further information about the debug event type, see Debug Event .",
