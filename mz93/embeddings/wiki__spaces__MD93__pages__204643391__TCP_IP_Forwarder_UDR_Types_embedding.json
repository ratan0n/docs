In the editing area right-click and select UDR Assistance... to open the UDR Internal Format Browser. Open TCPIPUDR RemoteHostConfig The RemoteHostConfig UDR contains the connection details for the remote host. This UDR is included in all the other UDR types. The following fields are included in the RemoteHostConfig: Field Description Field Description host (string) This field contains the hostname or IP address to the remote host. port (int) This field contains the port to the remote host. ConnectionRequestUDR When the agent receives this UDR, it tries to establish a new connection, or close a connection to a a remote host. The agent then returns the ConnectionStateUDR with information about the current state of the connection. The following fields are included in the ConnectionRequestUDR : Field Description Field Description closeConnection (boolean) This field determines whether the request is for opening or closing a connection. For a new connection, this field is set to false , and to close the connection, this field is set to true . remoteHost (RemoteHostConfig (TPCIP)) This is the RemoteHostConfig UDR that contains the connection details. ConnectionStateUDR The agent returns the ConnectionStateUDR when a ConnectionRequestUDR has been sent and if a connection goes down. The following fields are included in the ConnectionReqeustUDR : Field Description Field Description connectionOpen (boolean) If the connection is valid (see the validAddress field below), this field indicates if the connection is open or not ( true = open and false = closed). remoteHost (RemoteHostConfig (TPCIP)) This is the RemoteHostConfig UDR that contains the connection details. validAddress (boolean) This field indicates if the connection details in the RemoteHostConfig UDR are valid ( true = valid and false = invalid). RequestUDR When the agent receives a RequestUDR it tries to send the included bytearray to the remote host. The following fields are included in the RequestUDR: Field Description Field Description data (bytearray) This field contains the actual data to be sent. remoteHost (RemoteHostConfig (TPCIP)) This is the RemoteHostConfig UDR that contains the connection details. ResponseUDR If the TCP/IP forwarding agent is configured to handle responses, it returns ResponseUDR s to the workflow. The following fields are included in the ResponseUDR : Field Description Field Description data (bytearray) This field contains the response. remoteHost (RemoteHostConfig (TPCIP)) This is the RemoteHostConfig UDR that contains the connection details. Note! An internal buffer in the TCP/IP forwarding agent limits the maximum data size of a response. If the size exceeds 1024 bytes, the response may be split into multiple UDRs. For each response that exceeds the limit, the agent automatically increases the buffer size in a stepwise manner. ErrorUDR The agent returns the ErrorUDR in case a RequestUDR fails. The following fields are included in the ErrorUDR : Field Description Field Description data (bytearray) This is original data from the RequestUDR . This can be used to store the data. ErrorReason (string) This field contains the reason for the failure. ErrorStackTrace (string) This field contains the stack trace from the failure. Note! This field should only be read if absolutely necessary, since it requires a large amount of CPU. remoteHost (RemoteHostConfig (TPCIP)) This is the RemoteHostConfig UDR that contains the connection details. Note! The ErrorUDR type is a subtype of the ResponseUDR type. This means that if, for example, instanceOf(input,ErrorUDR) evaluates to true , then instanceOf(input,ResponseUDR) also evaluates to true .",
