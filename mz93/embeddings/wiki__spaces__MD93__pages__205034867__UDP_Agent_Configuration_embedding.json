Click Add agent and select UDP from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. UDP Tab Open UDP agent configuration dialog - UDP tab Setting Description Setting Description Host The IP address or hostname to which the UDP collector will bind. If the host is bound the port must also be bound. If this field is left empty, the UDP collector binds to all IP addresses available on the system. Port The port number from which the data is received, by default set to 3310. Make sure the port is not used by other applications. Decoder Tab Open UDP agent configuration - Decoder tab Setting Description Setting Description Decoder List holding available decoders introduced via the Ultra Format Editor . The decoders are named according to the following syntax: <decoder> (<module>) The option MZ Format Tagged UDRs indicate that the expected UDRs are stored in one of the built-in formats. If the compressed format is used, the decoder will automatically detect this. Select this option to make the Tagged UDR Type list accessible for configuration. If this option is selected, the Tagged UDR Type list will be enabled. Tagged UDR Type List of available internal UDR formats stored in the Ultra and Code servers. The formats are named according to the following syntax: <internal> (<module>) If the decoder is to reprocess UDRs of an internal format, the Decoder MZ format tagged UDRs has to be selected to enable this list. Once enabled, the internal format may be selected. Full Decode If enabled, the UDR will be fully decoded before inserted into the workflow. This may have a negative impact on performance since all fields may not be accessed in the workflow, making decoding of all fields unnecessary. If disabled (default), the amount of work needed for decoding is minimized, using a \"lazy\" method decoding sub fields. This means the actual decoding work may not be done until later in the workflow, when the field values are accessed for the first time. Corrupt data (that is, data for which decoding fails) may not be detected during the decoding stage and could cause the UDR to be discarded at a later processing stage.",
