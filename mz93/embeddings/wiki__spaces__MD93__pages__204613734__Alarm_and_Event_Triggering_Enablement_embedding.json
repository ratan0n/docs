Open Overview of Events in the Alarm and Event UI. By using an Event Notification configuration it will be possible to filter and stream events of all types and levels produced by various functions in real-time, as data is processed through the system. Valid destinations are files on the local disk, system log, and e-mail notifications. The following events are managed: Code Server events Node failures Node messages Node state changes System startup, shutdown, and failures Task Executor messages Task state changes User actions Workflow state changes Events can be generated in a format recognized by fault management and performance management systems, e.g. an SNMP trap. MediationZone provides for tracing and debug capabilities within its standard functionality. Descriptions and recommendations of what-to-do are provided as part of the standard documentation.",
