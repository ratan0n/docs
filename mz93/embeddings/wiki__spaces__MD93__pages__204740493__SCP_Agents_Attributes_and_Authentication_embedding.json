  "text": "Attributes The SCP collection agent and the SCP forwarding agent share a number of common attributes. They are both supported by a number of algorithms: 3des-cbc, 3des-ctr, blowfish-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256. Authentication The SCP agents support authentication through either username/password or private key. Private keys can optionally be protected by a Key password. Most commonly used private key files, can be imported into the system. Typical command line syntax (most systems): ssh-keygen -t <keyType> -f <directoryPath> Argument Description Argument Description keyType The type of key to be generated. Both RSA and DSA key types are supported. directoryPath Where to save the generated keys. Example The private key may be created using the following command line: > ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /tmp/keystore Enter passphrase: xxxxxx Enter same passphrase again: xxxxxx Then the following is stated: Your identification key has been saved in /tmp/keystore Your public key has been saved in /tmp/keystore.pub When the keys are created the private key may be imported to the SCP agent: Open Edit Private Key dialog Finally, on the SCP server host, append /tmp/keystore.pub to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys . If the $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys is not there it must be created.",
