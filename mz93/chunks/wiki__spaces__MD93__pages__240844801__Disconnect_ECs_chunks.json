This allows workflows and services to continue processing throughout the upgrade as long as the Execution Contexts are installed in a separate container from the platform. Any standalone workflow can continue executing during the platform container upgrade, the downtime of the workflows will be minimized to the upgrade of the individual Execution Container, and each container can be handled separately. To disconnect the ECs, run the following command: $ mzsh mzadmin/<password> disconnect <ec name> ... Note! Disconnected ECs may still attempt to contact the Platform. These attempts will fail and cause warning messages (No open connection to <Platform host> in the log files. Ignore these warning messages.",
