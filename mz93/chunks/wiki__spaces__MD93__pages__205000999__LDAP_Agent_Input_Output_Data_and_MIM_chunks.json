The agent expects the following UDR types: LdapAbandonRequestUDR LdapAddRequestUDR LdapCompareRequestUDR LdapDeleteRequestUDR LdapExtendedRequestUDR LdapModifyDNRequestUDR LdapModifyRequestUDR LdapRequestUDR LdapSearchRequestUDR The agent delivers the following UDR types: LdapAbandonResultUDR LdapAddResultUDR LdapCompareResultUDR LdapDeleteResultUDR LdapErrorUDR LdapExtendedResultUDR LdapModifyDNResultUDR LdapModifyResultUDR LdapResultUDR LdapRequestIDUDR LdapSearchResultUDR LdapSearchResultEntryUDR See LDAP Agent UDRs for further information.
