Refer to Couchbase Compatibility Matrix for supported Couchbase versions. In order for MediationZone to communicate with the Couchbase database, the couchbase.mzp package must be included in your installation. Download Couchbase Enterprise edition from http://www.couchbase.com and install according to the Couchbase documentation: https://docs.couchbase.com/home/index.html . Required Couchbase services are: Data Index Query Refer to docs.couchbase.com for the information about these services. Note! For the optimal Couchbase Server operations, you must set swappiness to 0 (zero) as described in the topic about swap space. You can now proceed with either creating data buckets in the Couchbase cluster by using the Couchbase profile in MediationZone either in combination with Distributed Storage, or with PCC. Couchbase data buckets can be created either directly in the Couchbase Web Console, or by using Couchbase profiles. See the Desktop User's Guide for further information about how to create buckets with Couchbase profiles.",
