When prompted to Select workflow type , select Batch. Click Add agent and select Kafka from the Collection tab in the Agent Selection dialog. Double-click on the agent in the workflow template. Open Kafka batch collection agent configuration Setting Description Setting Description Consumer Group The name of the consumer group which is defined by the group.id property. Batch Size The number of messages to collect per batch. Note that a workflow will remain in a running state even when all data has been consumed and you have to trigger a stop either using mzsh, or the operations REST interface, or in the workflow configuration by using a MIM like Estimated Lag or Workflow Throughput , for example. The Batch Size must be greater than 0. Note! For performance reasons, it is important to set a reasonable batch size. If the batch size is set too low, this will affect the performance negatively. Deactivate on idle If enabled, the agent will deactivate the workflow if it has no more batches to collect. Assignment Messages can be collected from one or several topics. You define how the topics should be identified by selecting either; Topic Pattern Enter a regular expression for the names of the topics you want to collect data from. https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html Topic Names Select this option to display a list and an Add button. Add one or several topic names that you want to collect data from. The exact names must be entered. Regular expressions cannot be used. Topic Partitions Select this option to display a list and an Add button. Add one or several topic names and partitions that you want to collect data from. The exact names must be entered. Regular expressions cannot be used. Below are a few examples of valid partition declarations: Example of collection from partition 0: Partitions: 0 Example of collection from the three partitions 0, 8 and 12: Partitions: 0,8,12 Example of collection from the six partitions 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7: Partitions: 0,3-7 Note! If you select Topic Partitions , automatic rebalancing will not take place, and you will have to handle potential rebalancing manually if needed. Note! You must configure a Kafka Profile in the Execution tab in Workflow Properties for the workflow configuration to be valid.",
