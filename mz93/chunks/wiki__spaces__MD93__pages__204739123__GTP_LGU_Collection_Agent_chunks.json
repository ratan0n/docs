    "text": "This section describes the GTP' LGU Collection agent. This is a collection agent for real-time workflow configurations. The GTP' LGU Collection agent collects messages and datagrams of charging protocol of type GTP' from GSM agents. By collecting this information the GTP' LGU Collection agent lets the platform act as a Charging Gateway device, providing Charging Gateway Functionality (CGF) within UMTS/GPRS networks. Open UMTS/GPRS Charging Gateway Functionality The GTP' LGU Collection agent awaits initialization from the GSN nodes of types SGSN and GGSN. When initiated, the agent interacts with the nodes over Datagram Protocol (UDP). In case of failure, the GTP' LGU Collection agent can be configured to notify the GSN nodes to route the incoming data to another host. An alternative configuration is to set up a second and identical workflow, on a separate Execution Context (EC). The agent counts the received requests and publishes those values as MIM values. Those MIM values can also be viewed from the command line tool with the wfcommand printcounters command. The GTP' LGU Collection agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Interaction Scenario The following scheme demonstrates the message and data transfer between the GSN nodes and the GTP' LGU Collection agent: When started, the GTP' LGU Collection agent sends a Node Alive Request message to all configured GSN nodes. The GTP' LGU Collection agent awaits a Node Alive Response and transmits Node Alive Request repeatedly, according to the Advanced tab settings. For further information, see Advanced Tab in GTP' LGU Collection Agent Configuration . After a successful Node Alive Response the GSN node starts to transmit Data Record Transfer Requests to the agent. When a request is collected, the agent replies with a Data Record Transfer Response message. When the GTP' LGU Collection agent receives an Echo Request message from a GSN node, it emits a GTPEchoRequestUDR to the workflow. The UDR contains the IP address, port of the connected GSN node, and timestamp (sent time) of the Echo Request message. When the workflow is stopped, it stops immediately by default. However, if you want Redirection Request messages to be sent to all configured GSN nodes when stopping the workflow, you can select the Redirection Request checkbox in the Miscellaneous tab in the Configuration dialog of the GTP' LGU Collection agent. The workflow then waits for a Redirection Response message from each of the GSN nodes before stopping. If the Max Wait for a Response (sec) value is exceeded, the workflow stops, regardless of whether Redirection Response messages from the GSN nodes have been received or not.
