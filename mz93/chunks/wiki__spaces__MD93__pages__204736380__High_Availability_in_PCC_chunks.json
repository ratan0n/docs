    "text": "This section describes different recommended high-availability setups and what is required in terms of hardware and software. Other options are, available but it is recommended that an expertise is consulted before a different deployment option is selected. Software and Network Requirements The PCC solution manages availability in different ways. [EZ] and [DR] manage availability by running several of them, while [CZ] requires a stand-by machine to fail over to. This chapter describes what is required for high availability and the possible consequences of not having full redundancy. Network In order to have full redundancy, the network needs to be equipped with redundant switches and all nodes in the solution need to have two network cards each. This is needed in order to manage a switch- or network card failure. Couchbase For information on high availability of Couchbase clusters, see CB v 6.0 or CB v 5.5 . Redis For information on the high availability of Amazon ElastiCache, see https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elasticache/ .",
