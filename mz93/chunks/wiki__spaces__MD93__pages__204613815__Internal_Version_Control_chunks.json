    "text": "When there are changes made to the configuration of a workflow (or agent), the new configuration is saved as a new version. It is possible to go back to any previous version of a workflow and then save it to become the new current version. This version can then be modified and saved as a new version. From the perspective of configuration, MediationZone enables a smooth transition from one instance to another, for example from test to production through its system export/import capability. System export/import includes the capability to migrate any selected configuration part of one MediationZone installation to another while still maintaining full version control on the importing side.",
