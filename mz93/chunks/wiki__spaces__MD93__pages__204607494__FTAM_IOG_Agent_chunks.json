Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: FTAM Documentation FTAM Responder Application, 56/155 17-ANZ 216 01 Uen, Ericsson The FTAM/IOG agent allows files from Ericsson IOG to be collected and inserted into a workflow using the FTAM protocol. The agent does not communicate directly with the IOG. Instead, it goes via the FTAM Interface service that must be running on a host in the network. The advantage of this implementation is that only one host has to be equipped with FTAM software. For further information about how the FTAM Interface service is maneuvered, see FTAM IOG Interface Service . The FTAM/IOG agent collects subfiles that are part of a composite main file on the IOG. When activated, the agent connects to the FTAM Interface service and requests the new data. The FTAM/IOG agent keeps track of the data to be collected by reading the contents of one or more directory control files, which maintains the status of the subfiles The FTAM/IOG agent may not be combined with other collectors in the same workflow. The section contains the following subsections: FTAM IOG Agent Configuration FTAM IOG Agent Transaction Behavior FTAM IOG Agent Input/Output Data and MIM FTAM IOG Agent Events FTAM IOG Interface Service",
