The Command Line Tool mzsh is a shell that can be used both as a system administration tool and as a Platform client tool. Depending on whether the Platform is running or not, or if you are logged in or not, mzsh enables you to access different parts of the system. Note! To start an application, or to activate a workflow, you must have Execute permissions for the application and configuration, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/hRwzD for more information. Some commands require that the user is the MZ_HOME owner. This information will be found together with the respective commands presented in this user guide. Caution! Ensure that the firewall is correctly configured as some commands require communication between the Execution Contexts and the Platform. For information about communication through firewalls, see the System Administrator's Guide .
