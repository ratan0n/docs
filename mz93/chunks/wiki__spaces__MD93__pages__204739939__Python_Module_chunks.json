    "text": "With the Python Module configurations, you can write shared Python code that can be imported by multiple Python agents. This allows you to organize your Python code into different modules that can be reused. Open Python Module To access the Python Module, click the New Configuration button and then select Python Module from the menu. The entire Python Module configuration is a code area where you can write code that you want Python agents to be able to import. See the code section for the relevant agent for further information. The imported modules are referenced by the workflows, but as each agent has its own memory space, global variables will not be shared between agents or workflows. Python Code Editor Assistance To provide assistance when you are writing code in the Python code area, there are several features in place: Syntax Highlighting - Different parts of the code are color-coded according to type Right-click Menu - A menu that provides editor options. Code Completion - Helps you to write Python code in the Python Code Editor by providing context-sensitive proposals. For further information on these features, see Python Code Editor Assistance .",
