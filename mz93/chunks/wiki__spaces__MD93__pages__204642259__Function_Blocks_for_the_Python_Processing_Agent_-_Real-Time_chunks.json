For examples and further information on writing code in the Python processing agent, see Python Writer's Guide . The following function blocks are supported by the Python processing agent: Function Block Description def initialize() This function block initializes resources and state. def consume(input) This function block consumes and processes UDRs. def timeout(obj) This function block is called when using the setTimeout function. UDRs may be routed in a timeout function block. When possible, always route to an asynchronous route from the timeout function block. def stop() This function block is called when the workflow is about to stop. def deinitialize() This function block will cleanup resources and state.",
