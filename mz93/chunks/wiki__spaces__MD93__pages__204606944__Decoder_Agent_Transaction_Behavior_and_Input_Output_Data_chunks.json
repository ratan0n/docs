The agent sends out commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Cancel Batch Emitted on failure to decode the received data. The agent acquires commands from other agents and, based on them, generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description End Batch Unless this has been generated by a Hint End Batch message, the decoder evaluates that all the data in the batch was decoded. When using a constructed or blocked decoder, the decoder does additional validation of the structural integrity of the batch. Input/Output Data The input/output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The agent produces one or more UDR types depending on configuration and consumes bytearray type or UDR depending on the configuration. In case of error, the agent may produce DecoderErrorUDR if the selected decoder supports it. Field Description Cause (ExeptionDetails) Information about an exception that has occurred Data (DRUDR) UDR input for the selected decoder",
