The following instructions assume the following: A private key for the certificate in PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format. In the example this private key is named private-key.pem . An X.509 trusted certificate configured with an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). In the example this trusted certificate is named server.crt . A file containing the CA certificate chain. Both root and intermediate certificates must be present. In the example this file is named ca.crt . Convert the X.509 certificate and private key to pkcs12 format: $ openssl pkcs12 -export -chain -in server.crt -inkey private-key.pem -out server.p12 -name amc-server -CAfile ca.crt Enter Export Password: <export-password> Verifying - Enter Export Password: <export-password> Convert the pkcs12 file to a keystore. Execute the following command, making sure that the keystore-password and key-password match the HTTP configuration settings, see HTTP Standard Setup . $ keytool -importkeystore  -deststorepass <keystore-password> -destkeypass <key-password>  -destkeystore containter.keys -srckeystore server.p12  -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass <export-password> -alias platform Note! The default keystore alias for the certificate is platform but can be reconfigured, see HTTP Configuration Properties . If this has been done, change the alias in the command provided above.
