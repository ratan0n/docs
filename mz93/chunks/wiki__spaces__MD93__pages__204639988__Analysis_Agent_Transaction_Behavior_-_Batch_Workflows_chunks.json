Input/Output Data The agent retrieves commands that changes the state of the file currently processed. Command Description End Batch The agent itself does not emit End Batch, however it can trigger the collector to do so by calling the hintEndBatch method. See the sections about beginBatch and endBatch in the APL Reference Guide for information about the hintEndBatch method. Cancel Batch The agent itself does not emit Cancel Batch however, it can trigger the collector to do so by calling the cancelBatch method. See the section about cancelBatch in the APL Reference Guide for further information. Hint End Batch If the code contains a call to the method hintEndBatch this will make the agent emit a Hint End Batch. Note! Not all collectors can act upon a call on a hintEndBatch request. Please refer to the user's guide for the respective Collection agent for information. The agent acquires commands from other agents and, based on them, generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Begin Batch When a Begin Batch message is received, the agent calls the beginBatch function block, if present in the code. Cancel Batch When a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent calls the cancelBatch function block, if present in the code. End Batch When an End Batch message is received, the agent calls the drain and endBatch function blocks, if present in the code.",
