To use DirectoryStorage , you must edit the pcc.properties file. Select a directory where DirectoryStorage will store its data by editing the following: mz.pcc.directorystorage.directory=${mz.home}/tmp/pcc Configure the properties mz.pcc.config.storage.class and mz.pcc.bucket.storage.class: config.storage.class=com.digitalroute.pcc.storage.config.directory.DirectoryStorage bucket.storage.class=com.digitalroute.pcc.buckets.storage.memory.MemoryBucketStorage Save the pcc.properties file. In order for the ECs to be able to locate the pcc.properties file, you must set the Execution Context property mz.pcc.properties . mzsh topo set topo://container:main1/pico:ec1/obj:config.properties.mz.pcc '{ properties=<path> }' Example - Setting mz.pcc.properties mzsh topo set topo://container:main1/pico:ec1/obj:config.properties.mz.pcc '{ properties=${mz.home}\"/etc/pcc.properties\" }' Since buckets are stored in memory with this setup, the bucket data will be lost if ECs are restarted. This setup must not be used in production.",
