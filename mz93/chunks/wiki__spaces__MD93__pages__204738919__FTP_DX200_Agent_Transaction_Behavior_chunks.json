    "text": "This section includes information about the FTP DX200 collection agent transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see 3.1.11 Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that changes the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Begin Batch Will be emitted right before the first byte of each collected file is fed into a workflow. End Batch Will be emitted just after the last byte of each collected file has been fed into the system. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents and based on them generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch to ECS. Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on the workflow level is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will never receive the last Cancel Batch message. In this situation, ECS will not be involved, and the file will not be deleted.",
