    "text": "In resemblance to Regular Expressions, when searching through text strings of names and other textual patterns in mzsh, there are two characters that help you filter text according to certain criteria: The asterisk '*' is a wildcard for one or more characters. The question mark '?' is a wildcard for any single character. Note! If you want to use the '*' and '?' wildcards when you are not logged in, the wildcards have to either be enclosed with single or double quotation marks or preceded with a backslash ''. For example: mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgrouplist * will work. mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgrouplist \"*\" will work. mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgrouplist * -mode D will not work. The period '.' punctuation mark is not a wildcard and is treated as normal punctuation mark character.",
