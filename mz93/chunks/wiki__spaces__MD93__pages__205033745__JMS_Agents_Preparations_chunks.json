For information about Connection Factory and Destination objects, see the JMS 1.1 specification: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html . The classpath for the JMS and JNDI jar files are specified for each EC. In the example below, the jar files are located in MZ_HOME/3pp. Note! Ensure that you include existing paths, so that they are not overwritten. $ mzsh topo get topo://container:<container>/pico:<ec>/obj:config.classpath Example - Setting classpath mzsh topo set topo://container:<container>/pico:<ec name> '{ template:mz.standard-ec config { classpath { jars=[\"jms/apache-activemq-5.0.0/activemq-all-5.0.0.jar\"] } } }' After the classpath is set, the jar file must be manually distributed to be in place when the EC is started",
