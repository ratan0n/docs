    "text": "This section includes information about the Netia FTP collection agent transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Begin Batch Emitted before the first byte of each collected file is fed into a workflow. End Batch Emitted after the last byte of each collected file has been fed into the system. Retrieves Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch to ECS. Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on workflow level is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will never receive the last Cancel Batch message. In this situation, ECS will not be involved, and the file will not be moved. APL code where Hint End Batch is followed by a Cancel Batch will always result in workflow abort. Make sure to design the APL code to first evaluate the Cancel Batch criteria to avoid this sort of behavior. Hint End Batch If a Hint End Batch message is received, the collector splits the batch at the end of the current block processed (32 kB), provided that no UDR is split. If the block end occurs within a UDR, the batch will be split at the end of the preceding UDR. After a batch split, the collector emits an End Batch Message, followed by a Begin Batch message (provided that there is data in the subsequent block).",
