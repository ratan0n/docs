While Prometheus allows you to monitor data, it handles one metric at a time. Grafana complements this by visualizing data from your Prometheus server, enabling you to create dashboards that display multiple metrics simultaneously. Grafana also offers advanced analytical tools to help you derive deeper insights from your data. To configure which metrics that will be exposed for scraping, use the Prometheus Filter. For more information, see The Prometheus Filter . This section contains the following sub section: Setting up Prometheus Setting up Grafana",
