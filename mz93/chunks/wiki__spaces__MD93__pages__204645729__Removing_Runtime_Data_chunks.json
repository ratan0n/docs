In some cases you may to remove this data, for example: To process KDR UDRs with timestamps that belong to a closed period. These will normally be discarded. To perform multiple test runs that should generetate identical results. To immediately remove data from Kafka topics that cannot be processed, e g after restart of the Spark cluster. Note! As prerequisite, the scripts must be prepared according to Preparing and Creating Scripts for KPI Management The following steps are required to remove all existing runtime data: Stop the KPI Management workflows. Stop the Spark cluster. $ stop.sh Stop the kpi-app and run: clean rm -fr $SPARK_APP_CHECKPOINT_DIR Remove data stored by Kafka, Zookeeper, and Spark. Note! Calculated KPIs for the current periods will be lost. $ rm -rf $MZ_HOME/storage/kafka/* $ rm -rf $MZ_HOME/storage/zookeeper/* $ rm -rf <checkpoint directory>/* The default checkpoint directory is mz_kpi app/data/spark-checkpoint-dir/<spark application name> . Start Kafka and Zookeeper. bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties & bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties Start Spark $ start_master_workers.sh Recreate the Kafka topics that are specified in the service configuration. For further information, see Spark, kafka and zookeeper . Run submit.sh kpiapp to submit the Spark application(s). See Submitting a Spark Application . Start the KPI Management workflows.",
