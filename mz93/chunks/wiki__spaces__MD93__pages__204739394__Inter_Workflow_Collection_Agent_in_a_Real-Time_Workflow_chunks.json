    "text": "To open the Inter Workflow collection agent configuration, click Build>New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select a workflow type , click Realtime . Click Add agent and select Inter Workflow from the Agent Selection dialog. Double-click the agent icon or right-click the icon and select Edit agent to display the Agent Configuration dialog. Inter Workflow Tab Open Inter Workflow collection agent real-time configuration dialog - Inter Workflow tab Setting Description Setting Description Profile Click Browse to select a profile to assign to the agent. All workflows in the same workflow configuration can use separate Inter Workflow profiles, if that is preferred. In order to do that the profile must be set to Default in the Workflow Table tab found in the Workflow Properties dialog. After that each workflow in the table can be appointed different profiles. Use Custom Stream Select this checkbox to enable Stream ID-based connections across multiple workflows using the same profile. When checked, collector and forwarding agents establish connections based on both the profile and a Stream ID, allowing workflows to link dynamically. In cases where a real-time workflow connects to a batch workflow, they scale as a unit, ensuring backend/frontend pairs stay linked via the Stream ID. Note! If this checkbox is cleared, the Inter Workflow profile is fixed at design time and cannot be changed dynamically, preventing chained workflows from scaling. Example - Configuring a Stream ID in Inter Workflow Forwarder and Collection Agents Scenario: You have multiple processing workflows that each need to send data to a specific collection workflow. Instead of creating separate Inter Workflow profiles for each pair, you can configure a stream ID to manage these connections within a single profile. For example, if three processing workflows (A, B, and C) need to send data to three corresponding collection workflows (X, Y, and Z), you can define stream IDs like \"A-X\", \"B-Y\", and \"C-Z\". This ensures each processing workflow sends data to the correct collection workflow while maintaining a simpler, more scalable configuration. Stream ID If you have checked the Use Custom Stream checkbox add a Stream ID. Decoder Tab Open Inter Workflow collection agent real-time configuration dialog - Decoder tab Setting Description Decoder Click Browse to select from a list of available decoders created in the Ultra Format Editor, as well as the default built-in decoders: CSV Format JSON Format MZ Tagged Format Different settings are available depending on the Decoder you select. Full Decode This option is only available when you have selected a decoder created in the Ultra Format Editor. Select this option to fully decode the UDR before it is sent out from the decoder agent. This action may have a negative impact on performance, since not all fields may be accessed in the workflow, making decoding of all fields in the UDR unnecessary. If it is important that all decoding errors are detected, you must select this option. If this checkbox is cleared (default), the amount of work needed for decoding is minimized using \"lazy\" decoding of field content. This means that the actual decoding work may be done later in the workflow, when the field values are accessed for the first time. Corrupt data (that is, data for which decoding fails) may not be detected during the decoding stage, but can cause a workflow to abort later in the process. MZ Tagged Specific Settings Tagged UDR Type Click the Add button to select from a list of available internal UDR formats stored in the Ultra and Code servers to reprocess UDRs of an internal format and send them out. If the compressed format is used, the decoder automatically detects this. JSON Specific Settings UDR Type Click Browse to select the UDR type you want the Decoder to send out. You can either select one of the predefined UDRs or the DynamicJson UDR, which allows you to add a field of type any for including payload. Unmapped Fields If you have selected DynamicJson as UDR Type , you can select the option data in this field in order to include payload. If you have selected another UDR type that contains an any, or a map field, you can select to put any unmapped fields into the field you select in this list. All fields of any or map type in the selected UDR type will be available. If set to (None), any unmapped fields will be lost. Schema Path Enter the path to the JSON schema you want to use in this field. CSV Specific Settings UDR Type Click Browse to select the UDR type you want the Decoder to send out. You can either select one of the predefined UDRs or the DynamicCsv UDR if the CSV format is not known. Format Select the CSV format you want to use; Unix , Mac , Windows , or Excel , or select to define your own customized format. If you select Custom , the following four settings will be enabled. Delimiter Enter the delimiter character(s) for the fields in the CSV. Use Quote Select this option if quotes are used in the CSV. Quote If Use Quote is selected, enter the type of quotes used in the CSV. Line Break Enter how line breaks are expressed in the CSV.",
