    "text": "Warning! MultiForwarding is not fully supported for ADLS2 File Forwarding as of version 8.1.5.0 When the agent is set to use MultiForwardingUDR input, it accepts input of the UDR type MultiForwardingUDR declared in the package FNT. The declaration follows: internal MultiForwardingUDR { // Entire file content byte[] content; // Target filename and directory FNTUDR fntSpecification; }; The content of the MultiForwardingUDR will be stored at the path that you have set in the fntSpecification field. Use the APL functions fntAddString and fntAddDirDelimiter to set the value of this field. For further information about these functions, see FNTUDR Functions in APL Reference Guide . When the files are received they are written to temp files in the DR_TMP_DIR directory situated in the root output folder. The files are moved to their final destination when an end batch message is received. A runtime error will occur if any of the fields have a null value or if the path is invalid on the target file system. A UDR of the type MultiForwardingUDR which has a target filename that is not identical to its precedent is saved in a new output file. Note! After a target filename that is not identical to its precedent is saved, you cannot use the first filename again. For example: Saving filename B after saving filename A, prevents you from using A again. Instead, you should first save all the A filenames, then all the B filenames, and so forth. Non-existing directories will be created if the Create Non-Existing Directories check box under the Filename Template tab is checked. If not checked, a runtime error will occur if a previously unknown directory exists in the FNTUDR of an incoming MultiForwardingUDR . Every configuration option referring to bytearray input is ignored when MultiForwardingUDR s are expected. Example - APL code to send MultiForwardingUDRs This example shows the APL code used in an Analysis agent connected to a forwarding agent expecting input of type MultiForwardingUDR s. import ultra.FNT; MultiForwardingUDR createMultiForwardingUDR (string dir, string file, bytearray fileContent){ //Create the FNTUDR FNTUDR fntudr = udrCreate(FNTUDR); fntAddString(fntudr, dir); fntAddDirDelimiter(fntudr);//Add a directory fntAddString(fntudr, file);//Add a file MultiForwardingUDR multiForwardingUDR = udrCreate(MultiForwardingUDR); multiForwardingUDR.fntSpecification = fntudr; multiForwardingUDR.content = fileContent; return multiForwardingUDR; } consume { bytearray file1Content; strToBA (file1Content, \"file nr 1 content\"); bytearray file2Content; strToBA (file2Content, \"file nr 2 content\"); //Send MultiForwardingUDRs to the forwarding agent udrRoute(createMultiForwardingUDR (\"dir1\", \"file1\", file1Content)); udrRoute(createMultiForwardingUDR (\"dir2\", \"file2\", file2Content)); } The Analysis agent mentioned previous in the example will send two MultiForwardingUDR s to the forwarding agent. Two files with different contents will be placed in two separate sub folders in the root directory. The Create Non-Existing Directories check box under the Filename Template tab in the configuration of the forwarding agent must be checked if the directories do not previously exist.",
