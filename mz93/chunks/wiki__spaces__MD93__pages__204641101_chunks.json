    "text": "The Search ECS dialog allows the user to filter out and locate erroneous UDRs and batches in the ECS. Any search settings you make can also be saved as filters that you can use for future searches. The Search ECS dialog is displayed when the Search option is selected in the ECS Inspector. Select UDRs or Batches to display UDR or batch specific options. Open Search ECS dialog Search Options The entries in the ECS can be either UDRs or batches. Depending on the selected type, different search options are available. Common Search Options The following settings are available for both UDRs and batches in the ECS. Search Option Description Search Option Description Saved Filters This is the column to the left in the dialog. This column lists any previously saved filters. For more information about how to create a filter, see section Saving Search Settings as a Filter below. Workflow The name of the workflow that sent the entry to the ECS. Agent The name of the agent that sent the entry to the ECS. Error Code An Error Code that has been defined in the ECS Inspector. See ECS Error Codes for further information. Error Case A list displaying the Error Cases associated with the selected Error Code. If the entry is too long to fit in the field, the field can be expanded by enlarging the ECS Inspector in order to display the entire error case text. An Error Case is a string, associated with a defined Error Code. Error Cases can only be appended via APL code: udrAddError( <UDR>, <Error Code>, <Error Case> ); Note! When Batches is selected, the <UDR> parameter is the error UDR. MIM It is possible to configure a workflow to send descriptive MIM values with the actual data (in the Workflow Properties window). This can be used to refine the search in the ECS. Insert Period Select this checkbox to search for UDRs or batches that have been inserted into the ECS during a specific time period. Choose User Defined and specify start time ( From ) and end time ( To ), or use one of the predefined intervals, e.g. Last Hour , Today , This Week . Reprocessing Group Contains a list of all reprocessing groups. Unassigned UDRs or Batches list all entries not associated with any reprocessing group. Reprocessing State Filter based on state, which can be New or Reprocessed . Only entries in state New may be collected. Search Options for Batches The following settings are only available when searching for batches in the ECS Search Option Description Search Option Description Cancel Agent The name of the agent that cancelled the batch. Cancel Message The error message sent as an argument with the cancelBatch function. Error UDR Type The type of Error UDR that can optionally be sent with a batch, containing important MIM information (or any other desired information when the UDR is populated via APL). Search Options for UDRs The following settings are only available when searching for UDRs in the ECS. Search Option Description Search Option Description UDR Type The type of UDR you want to search for. Tag If you have tagged UDRs, this option can be used for displaying only UDRs with the stated tag. Reprocessing State Change Period Select this checkbox to search for UDRs that last changed state (to New or Reprocessed ) during a specific time period. Choose User Defined and specify start time ( From ) and end time ( To ), or use one of the predefined intervals, e.g. Last Hour , Today , This Week . Search Fields If you have selected to search for UDRs , there is an Advanced tab, where you can select to Search Fields . Here, you can enter specific values for different UDR labels that you have configured, see Configuring Searchable Fields in the ECS . Only UDRs containing the specified values will be displayed in the ECS Inspector. Example For example, with the following setting: Open Only UDRs with IMSI 2446888776 are displayed in the ECS Inspector, provided that the label IMSI has been mapped to the IMSI field in the UDRs. Wild cards and intervals can also be used when entering the values for the fields; \" * \" can be used for matching any or no characters, and intervals can be set by using brackets \" [ ] \". When using the * or [ ] , the following rules apply: Only one wild card and one interval can be used per value. An interval is defined with a start value and an end value. If the interval consists of the same number of digits as start and end values, the match is made based on the specified number of digits, e.g. (a[001-002]) matches a001 but not a01 . If the interval consists of different numbers of digits as start and end values, the match is made based on an appropriate number of digits in the UDR, e.g. (a[1-20]) matches a1 and a20 , but not a01 or a020 . Only one interval can be stated within the \" [ ] \". The start and end values have to consist of numbers. The start value cannot be larger than the end value. The start value cannot have a larger amount of numbers than the end value, e.g. [0001-3] . If a setting for a value is not correct, an error message is displayed as a tooltip. In order for a UDR to pass the filter, all the defined values have to match. Example For example, with the following setting: Open Only UDRs with: A Number starting with 468 AND B Number starting with 47 AND Location Area Code 10 to 20 will be displayed. Saving Search Settings as a Filter When the search settings have been made, you can select to save these settings as a filter. Warning! If you have included search criteria that refer to parameters previously defined in your system, such as error codes, tags, search fields, etc, such filters will not work properly if you delete any of the defined parameters. To save a filter: Set the search options you want and click Save (bottom left corner button). A dialog opens asking you to enter a name for the filter. Open Entering Filter Name Enter a name in the Filter Name field and click OK . The dialog closes and the new filter appears in the Saved Filters list. The next time you want to use the same search settings, click the filter name in the Saved Filters list and the saved search settings are displayed. Hint! Any saved filters can be renamed or deleted by selecting the filter and clicking the Rename or Delete buttons.",
