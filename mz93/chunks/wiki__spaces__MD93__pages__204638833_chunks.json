    "text": "The DB Ref Event is triggered when a user performs any of the following operations on its tables: Commits changes to a database table Performs import operations If Enable Advanced Logging is selected in a Reference data profile, additional information will be included as follows: SQL statements for commit operations Generated SQL and log files' locations for import operations For more information about Reference Data Management, see the Reference Data Management user's guide. Filtering In the Event Setup tab, the values for all the event fields are set by default to All in the Match Value(s) column, which will generate event notifications every time a DB Ref event is generated. Double-click on the field to open the Match Values dialog where you can click on the Add button to add which values you want to filter on. If there are specific values available, these will appear in a drop-down list. Alternatively, you can enter a hard coded string or a regular expression. The following fields are available for filtering of DB Ref events in the Event Setup tab: DB Ref event specific fields profileIdentity - This fields contains the name of the Data Reference profile. user - This field contains the name of the user that performed the operation. Fields inherited from the Base event The following fields are inherited from the Base event, and can also be used for filtering, and described in more detail in Base Event : category - If you have configured any Event Categories, you can select to only generate notifications for DB Ref events with the selected categories. See Event Category for further information about Event Categories. contents - This field contains a string with event specific information. If you want to use this field for filtering you can enter a part of the contents as a hard coded string. eventName - This field can be used to specify which event types you want to generate notifications for. This may be useful if the selected event type is a parent to other event types. However, since the DB Ref event is not a parent to any other event, this field will typically not be used for this event. origin - This field always contains the IP address of the Platform. severity - With this field you can determine to only generate notifications for events with a certain severity; Information, Warning, Error or Disaster. timeStamp - This field contains the date and time for when the Platform generated the event. If you want to use timeStamp for filtering, it may be a good idea to enter a regular expression, for example, \"2014-06-15 09:.*\" for catching all DB Ref events from 9:00 to 9:59 on the 15th of June, 2014. Note! The values of these fields may also be included in the notifications according to your configurations in the Notifier Setup tab.",
