Typical usage of Data Hub includes: Data tracing Temporary archiving Analytics Integration with external systems Staging data for further processing Data Hub requires access to Cloudera Impala, which provides high-performance, low-latency SQL queries on data stored in an Hadoop filesystem (HDFS). The Data Hub Forwarding Agent bulk loads data in CSV files to HDFS and then inserts it into a Parquet table in the Impala database specified by a Data Hub Profile . The table data is then available for query via Data Hub Query . In a production environment, it is recommended that the size of the collected files ranges between 1 to 100 MB. Though it is possible to collect and process small batches the overhead of handling a large number of files will have significant impact on performance. You may remove old data from the Impala database with the Data Hub task agent.
