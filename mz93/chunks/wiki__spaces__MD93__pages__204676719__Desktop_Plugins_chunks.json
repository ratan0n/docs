Open Desktop DRDesktopPlugin Desktop plugins are introduced by implementing the interface DRDesktopPlugin . The Code Server will locate all such classes and add them in a menu called Extensions in Desktop. The purpose of DRDesktopPlugin is to act as a pure representation class of the actual Swing implementation. It is therefore recommended to separate the plugin class and the actual Swing implementation, since all DRDesktopPlugins are instantiated during startup and may allocate memory from the JVM. Based on the result from the method getMenuName , the plugin can be put into its own submenu. When a user selects the menu item, the startPlugin method is called where the returned Java Swing internal frame is displayed. For a Desktop plugin example, see: com.digitalroute.devkit.examples.udrlister.*",
