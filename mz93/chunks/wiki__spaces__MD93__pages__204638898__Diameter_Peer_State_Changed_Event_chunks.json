    "text": "When you run a Diameter workflow, the peer connections of the Diameter Stack agents are monitored through the standard Diameter watchdog as described in RFC 6733 and RFC 3539. Possible states of the connection are: OKAY, SUSPECT, DOWN, REOPEN, INITIAL. The Diameter peer state changed event is triggered whenever there is a change of peer state. Filtering In the Event Setup tab, the values for all the event fields are set by default to All in the Match Value(s) column, which will generate event notifications every time a Diameter peer state changed event is generated. Double-click on the field to open the Match Values dialog where you can click on the Add button to add which values you want to filter on. If there are specific values available, these will appear in a drop-down list. Alternatively, you can enter a hard coded string or a regular expression. Diameter peer state changed specific fields The following fields are available for filtering Diameter Peer State events in the Event Setup tab: newState - The new state of the connection. peerName - The name of the Diameter peer for which the connection state has changed. Fields inherited from the Base event The following fields are inherited from the Base event, and can also be used for filtering, and described in more detail in Base Event : category - If you have configured any Event Categories, you can select to only generate notifications for Couchbase Monitor events with the selected categories. See Event Category for further information about Event Categories. contents - This field contains a string with event specific information. If you want to use this field for filtering you can enter a part of the contents as a hard coded string. eventName - This field can be used to specify which event types you want to generate notifications for. This may be useful if the selected event type is a parent to other event types. However, since the Couchbase Monitor event is not a parent to any other event, this field will typically not be used for this event. origin - If you only want to generate notifications for events that are issued from certain Execution Contexts, you can specify the IP addresses of these Execution Contexts in this field. receiveTimeStamp - This fi eld contains the date and time for when the event was inserted into the Platform database. If you want to use timeStamp for fi ltering, it may be a good idea to enter a regular expression, for example, \"2014-06.*\" for catching all Diameter Peer State Changed events from 1st of June, 2014, to 30th of June, 2014. severity - With this fi eld you can determine to only generate noti fi cations for events with a certain severity; Information, Warning, Error or Disaster. timeStamp - This fi eld contains the date and time for when the Execution Context generated the event. If you want to use timeStamp for fi ltering, it may be a good idea to enter a regular expression, for example, \"2014-06-15 09:.*\" for catching all Diameter Peer State Changed events from 9:00 to 9:59 on the 15th of June, 2014. Fields inherited from the Workflow event The following fields are inherited from the Workflow event, and described in more detail in Workflow Event : workflowKey - The name of the internal workflow key. workflowName - A list indicating what workflow(s) information to select. workflowGroupName - The name of the workflow group. Fields inherited from the Agent event The following fields are inherited from the Agent event, and described in more detail in Agent Event : agentName - The name of the agent issuing the event. Note! The values of these fields may also be included in the notifications according to your configurations in the Notifier Setup tab.",
