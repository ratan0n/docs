    "text": "The Python collection agent can collect data from any source supported by Python in batch by defining an execute block. It also uses an Interpreter profile that is used to configure the Python executable. If you have created several Interpreter profiles, you may also set which one you want to be the default one. If this is done, you will not have to select a profile in the agent configuration, as the default profile is used by default. Using the Python collection agent allows you to control the workflow execution from the execute block and to stop routing when requested, from the stop block.
