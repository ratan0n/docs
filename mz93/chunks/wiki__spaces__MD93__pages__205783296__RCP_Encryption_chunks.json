To enable TLS, various configurations need to be made in the Platform and pico-instance settings. Furthermore, TLS can be used with or without authentication. The TLS support uses a keystore file, generated by using the Java standard tool keytool . For further information about keytool , see the JDK product documentation. Crypto algorithms are in place in the system to ensure secure data communication. The default crypto algorithms used are AES. If you require to modify the default crypto algorithms, see Platform Properties (to be removed) or Desktop Properties .
