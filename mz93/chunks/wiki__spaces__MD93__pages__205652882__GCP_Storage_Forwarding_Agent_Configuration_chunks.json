When prompted to select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add Agent and select GCP Storage from the Forwarding tab of the Agent Selection dialog. The GCP Storage Forwarder tab contains settings related to the placement and handling of the source files to be forwarded by the agent. Open Setting Description Setting Description Profile Select the File System profile you want the agent to use, see File System Profile for further information about this profile. Input Type For an example see GCP Storage Forwarding MultiForwardingUDR Example . Directory The absolute pathname of the target directory on the location stated in the referenced File System profile, where the forwarded files will be stored. The files will be temporarily stored in the automatically created subdirectory DR_TMP_DIR , in the target directory. When an End Batch message is received, the files are moved from the subdirectory to the target directory. Create Directory Select this setting to create the directory, or the directory structure, of the path that you specify in the Directory field. Note! The directories are created when the workflow is executed. Compression A compression type of the target files. Determines if the agent will compress the files or not. - No Compression - agent does not compress the files. Default setting. - Gzip - agent compresses the files using gzip. Note! No extra extension will be appended to the target filenames, even if compression is selected. The configuration of the filenames is managed in the Filename Template tab only. Command If a UNIX command is supplied, it will be executed on each successfully closed temporary file, using the parameter values declared in the Arguments field. Note! At this point the temporary file is created and closed, however, the final filename has not yet been created. The entered command has to exist in the execution environment, either including an absolute path, or to be found in the PATH for the execution environment. Arguments This field is optional. Each entered parameter value has to be separated from the preceding value with a space. The temporary filename is inserted as the second last parameter, and the final filename is inserted as the last parameter, automatically. This means that if, for instance, no parameter is given in the field, the arguments will be as follows: $1=<temporary_filename> $2=<final_filename> If three parameters are given in the field Arguments, the arguments are set as: $1=<parameter_value_#1> $2=<parameter_value_#2> $3=<parameter_value_#3> $4=<temporary_filename> $5=<final_filename> Produce Empty Files If enabled, files will be produced although containing no data.
