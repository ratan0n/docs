For information on how to extend the Redis database, see https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elasticache/ . Note! Created or updated Redis profiles that are used for PCC do not become effective until you restart the ECs. Redis Profiles A Redis profile is used to read and write data in a Redis database. This profile can be accessed by workflows using Aggregation, Distributed Storage or PCC. As a client to Redis, the profile operates in synchronous mode. When sending a request to Redis, the profile expects a server response, indicating success or failure, before proceeding to send the next one in queue. PCC using a Redis profile has been verified using Amazon ElastiCache. For information about how to create a Redis profile, see Redis Profile .",
