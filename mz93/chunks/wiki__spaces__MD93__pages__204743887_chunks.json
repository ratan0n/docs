Use the importrollback command only to revert the systemimport command and not for the purpose of a general system rollback.

This way, you can revert to an earlier system configuration by simply using systemimport . Note! The ECS Reprocessing Groups and ECS error codes are not removed by the importrollback command. The rollback file parameter provides importrollback with information that enables the system to reconstruct the status of your system prior to applying the systemimport command. For further information about systemimport see systemimport .
