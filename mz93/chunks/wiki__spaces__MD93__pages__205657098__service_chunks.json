This command is valid only for the MZ_HOME owner. The command enables you to manage the services which are configured and hosted in Service Contexts. start Use service start to start the platform and Service Contexts. When you call service start, the platform orchestrates the start-up of defined service instances ( standard-services.conf and custom-services.conf ) and saves the configuration produced. The command accepts the following option: [-s, --scope <all | custom | standard> Use this option to choose which services you want to start. Example. To start both standard and custom services, you may call the following: mzsh service start or mzsh service start --scope all To start only custom or standard services, run mzsh service start --scope custom or mzsh service start --scope standard restart Use service restart when the platform is restarted while some or all of the Service Contexts are kept running, e g, after Platform failure and recovery, or after scheduled maintenance of the Platform. When you call service restart , the command applies the configuration state saved by the service start command, so that all service instances are configured the same way as when the service start was issued. At the very least, service restart republishes the information required to connect to a service instance, e g, from a workflow). However, it also causes any service members found to be missing in the Service Contexts, to be restarted - this may happen when a failure and recovery affects the platform and some of the Service Contexts. When the Platform is restarted, while Service Contexts are active, you must also restart the embedded services using this command. The command accepts the following option: [--publish-only] Use this option to only publish the service configuration in the platform registry. This option can be used if you first upgrade the platform and then execute a rolling upgrade of Service Contexts. Using the option will not restart any service members. dump Use service dump to display very detailed information in HOCON format on all the services running. This information is mainly intended for support and troubleshooting. info Use service info to display information on all of the services running or a specific service instance. The command accepts the following options: [-d, --detailed] Use this option to display detailed information on all of the services running. [-i, --instance <provider/service instance>] Use this option to display detailed information on a specific service instance. Example. For information on all of the services running, you call the following: mzsh service info For detailed information on all of the services running, you call the following: mzsh mzadmin/dr service info --detailed For information on a specific service, you must specify the service provider/service instance, for example: mzsh service info --instance kafka/kafka1 list Use service list to display information on all available service providers. update Use service update to send custom commands to the service instance. [-c, --command] Use this option to specify a custom command. [-i, --instance <provider/service instance> ] Use this option to specify a specific service instance that should be updated.
