    "text": "An event is an object containing information related to an event. For example, there are Workflow State events that are emitted each time the state of a workflow is changed. The Event Notification configuration subscribes to these events and routes them to notifiers, for example, log files or a database. An Event Type is comprised of a set of fields containing the original event message, a set of standard workflow related information, and event specific fields that are the parameters the original event message. An Event Message contains information ordered in fields All event types in the system inherit fields from the Base event type. Workflow related events inherit fields related to the Workflow event as well, such as agentName . In addition to these, User Defined Events will receive any fields as defined by the user. There are two types (hierarchies) of events: User Defined events. Events inherited from a Base event (all other events), with additional information added. The user-defined event must be configured in an Ultra Format configuration. Other than the fields entered by the user, the system will automatically add basic fields. User Defined Events may only be dispatched from an agent using APL, i e Analysis or Aggregation. User defined events are sent from Analysis or Aggregation agents Fields added by the user must be populated manually by using APL commands, while the basic fields are populated automatically. From the basic fields, only category and severity may be assigned values. The other basic fields are read only, hence it is not possible to assign values to them.",
