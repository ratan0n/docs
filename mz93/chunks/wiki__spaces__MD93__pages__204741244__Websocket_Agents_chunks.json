    "text": "WebSocket is a protocol that enables bidirectional communication over a single TCP connection. The protocol is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol and the only relation to HTTP is that the handshake is done as an HTTP upgrade request. The WebSocket protocol makes it easier to send real-time data to and from the server by enabling content to be sent to the client without the client having to make a request. Netty version 3 is deprecated from version 9.0.0 of MediationZone. In MediationZone there are both a Websocket Server agent, and a Websocket Client agent. These are collection agents for real-time workflows. Shown below are two workflows using the Websocket Server and Websocket Client. Open Websocket Server workflow Open Websocket Client workflow Supported Protocol Specification The WebSocket protocol has been implemented according to RFC 6455.
