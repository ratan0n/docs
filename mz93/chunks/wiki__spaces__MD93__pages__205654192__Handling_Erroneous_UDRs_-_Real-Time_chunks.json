    "text": "The SQL forwarding agent encapsulates an erroneous UDR along with the error message that describes the error, in a new UDR. This in turn, enables you to process the faulty UDR, adjust the processing according to the error type, and prevent the workflow from aborting due to selected errors types. If Retry Commit for every UDR in batch is enabled, an errorUDR is routed out. If this option is not selected, an errorUDRList containing all the UDRs for that batch is routed out. Example - Handling erroneous UDRs in a real-time workflow Consider the following workflow: Open Example of a real-time workflow with an SQL forwarding agent The SQL forwarding agent identifies the asciiSEQ_TI UDR as erroneous, creates an errorUDR UDR that wraps together the original UDR with the error message that was generated. The erroneous UDR before and after SQL forwarding If you have selected the option Retry Commit for every UDR in batch , an errorUDRList UDR is routed instead. Open The ErrorUDRList UDR",
