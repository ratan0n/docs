    "text": "In order to send a UDR to the ECS, a workflow must contain an ECS forwarding agent. To perform a table lookup for all UDRs, an Analysis agent is used. If the lookup succeeded, the UDR is sent on the OK route to be saved on disk, while failing UDRs are sent to the ECS forwarding agent. Open A workflow sending UDRs to ECS UDRs may be sent to the ECS without any Error Code or MIM values associated with it. However, this will make browsing the ECS Inspector more difficult, and no auto-assignment to reprocessing groups using the Error Code is possible. ECS Inspector Error Codes can be associated with reprocessing groups via the ECS Inspector dialog ( Reprocessing Groups button). In this way, UDRs with an Error Code are automatically assigned to the respective reprocessing group. Otherwise, the UDRs have to be assigned manually to be available for collection. Open Add Error Code dialog - where a reprocessing group can be selected Analysis Agent The Analysis agent is used to validate and route UDRs, and to associate to a valid (existing) Error Code. The following example appends an Error Code and an Error Case to the UDR prior to sending it to the ECS forwarding agent. Example - appending an error code and an error case to the UDR prior to sending udrAddError( input, \"AreaCode_ERROR\", \"Complete anumber: \" + input.anum); udrRoute( input, \"error\" ); ECS Forwarding Agent In the ECS forwarding agent, the MIM values you want to associate with the UDR are appended. This is optional, however, it makes it easier to search for data and get additional information about the UDR from the ECS Inspector. Open The ECS forwarding agent",
