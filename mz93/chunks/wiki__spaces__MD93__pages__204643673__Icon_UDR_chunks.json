    "text": "The Icon UDR is used to create a Font Awesome icon. The icon name must match one from the Font Awesome library, which requires an internet connection. Alternatively, you can use the Line Awesome library, which is bundled in MediationZone and does not require internet access. To use Line Awesome, set the lineAwesome property to true and use the corresponding Line Awesome icon names, for example, la-ban instead of fa-ban . You can also stack two icons. The icon specified in the stackedIconName field will appear on top and be slightly larger than the one below. Open To create the stacked icon shown above, enter the following code: Icon clearSearchIcon = udrCreate(Icon); clearSearchIcon.iconName = \"fa-magnifying-glass\"; clearSearchIcon.iconStyle = clearSearchIcon.SOLID; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconName = \"fa-ban\"; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconStyle = clearSearchIcon.SOLID; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconColor = \"tomato\"; The following fields are included in the Icon UDR : Field Description Field Description attributes (map<string,string>) This field may contain extra attributes to be added. cssClasses (list<string>) This field may contain a list of extra values added to class attribute.
