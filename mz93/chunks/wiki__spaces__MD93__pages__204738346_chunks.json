    "text": "The Data Veracity Profile is used to select the particular database that Data Veracity will be connected. The profile can also generate the SQL scripts to be used for creating the database tables where the erroneous UDRs will be stored in. The Data Veracity profile is loaded when you start a workflow that depends on it. Changes to the profile become effective when you restart the workflow. Configuration To create a new Data Veracity profile, click the New Configuration button from the Configuration dialog available from Build View , and then select Data Veracity Profile from the menu. The contents of the menus in the menu bar may change depending on which configuration type has been opened in the currently active tab. The Data Veracity profile uses the standard menu items and buttons that are visible for all configurations, and these are described in Common Configuration Buttons . UDR Tab Open Data Veracity profile - UDR Tab The following settings are available in the UDR Tab of the Data Veracity profile: Setting Description Setting Description Database Profile This is the database the agent will connect and send data to. Click the Browse... button to get a list of all the database profiles that are available. For further information see Database Profile . Data Veracity is supported for use with the following databases: PostgreSQL 13 PostgreSQL 14 PostgreSQL 15 Oracle Database 19c SAP HANA 2.0 SP 7 UDR Type Mapping UDR Type Mapping UDRs to be used by the Data Veracity Profile are listed here MIM Mapping Use MIM Select this check box to allow the use MIMs listed under the Named MIMs table. Named MIMs This list will display the user-defined MIMs that can be made available for use by the Data Veracity Forwarding Agent. Generate SQL This text box will generate the SQL statements for the selected UDRs' table schema and indexes for the TXN_ID, ERROR_CODE, INSERT_TIME and STATE field. The schema will be generated based on the number of UDRs in the UDR Type Mapping table. Click the SQL button to generate the SQL statements. Warning! Users will have to copy the SQL script generated in the text box to create the Data Veracity tables on their own in the database listed in the Database profile. The Data Veracity profile will not automatically create the tables for you. PostgreSQL Schema Name There will not be a schema name included with the SQL command generated for PostgreSQL. Info! The user should create adequate indexes along with the indexes already provided by the script, in order to achieve the best performance for Data Veracity. Note! The name of the column constraints will be based on the Internal UDR name. An example would be, if an Internal UDR is named customerTI, the name of the column constraints will be prefixed with customerTI. When there are multiple Internal UDRs with identical names but present in different folders in your configuration, the names of the column constraints will be the same as well. This will cause a conflict error to occur when creating the table in your Database. It is highly recommended to have proper naming conventions for Internal UDRs, to prevent any conflicts. Batch Tab Open Data Veracity profile - Batch Tab The following settings are available in the Batch Tab of the Data Veracity profile: Setting Description Setting Description Database Profile This is the database the agent will connect and send data to.
