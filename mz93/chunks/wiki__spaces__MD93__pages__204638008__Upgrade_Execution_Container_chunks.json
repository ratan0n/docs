Refer to Java 17 documentation for details on  Obsolete Java Options  and  Removed Java Options  since Java 8. Refer to Managing Picos with Topo for JVM Arguments configuration. To upgrade an Execution Container, follow these steps: Before starting the upgrade process, ensure you have performed all necessary backups. Copy the MZ license file to the release directory and prepare the install.xml file. To do this, follow the steps in Upgrade Preparations to change the necessary fields to the respective Execution Container values. Note! Ensure that the install.type value is set to ec only when upgrading the Execution Container. These properties should be configured according to the platform container setup. For more information, refer to Execution Container Properties . Pre-upgrade validations are performed to verify the environment and configuration, ensuring a seamless upgrade experience. To perform validation without starting the upgrade, run the following command: $ ./setup.sh upgrade -validate-only Run the following command to initiate the upgrade process: $ ./setup.sh upgrade Note! If the upgrade validation fails, there is no need to perform a rollback or restore, as the upgrade process has not yet begun. If validation fails but you choose to proceed, you can run the following command: $ ./setup.sh upgrade -skip-validate Caution! You can choose to skip validation, but be aware that this bypasses checks for potential issues in your environment and configuration. If there are undetected problems, the upgrade may fail or cause unexpected behavior. Proceed with caution and ensure you have backups before continuing.",
