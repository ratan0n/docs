With the Archiving agents, it is possible to archive data batches for a configurable period of time. There are two agents: The Archiving agent stores the data on the platform machine. The Local Archiving agent stores the data locally on the Execution Context machine. Note that local data cannot be exported. The Archiving agents can be configured to archive all received data batches. Each data batch is saved as a file in a user-specified repository. The Archiving agent also saves a corresponding reference in the database, enabling the Archive Inspector to browse and purge the data batch files. Depending on the selected profile, the Archive services are responsible for the naming and storing of each file, and the purging of outdated files on a regular basis. Utilizing the Directory Templates and base directories specified in the Archive profile, directory structures are dynamically built when files are stored. The system administrator defines what structure is suitable for each profile. For instance, setting the directory structure to be changed with respect to the collecting agent name on a daily basis. The Archive services automatically create all directories needed in the base directory or directories. Configuration You configure an ar chiv ing agent in three steps: Define an Archive profile.
