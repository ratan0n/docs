    "text": "Input/Output Data The Input/Output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The agent produces UDRs in accordance with the Decoder tab, along with BeginBatch, EndBatch, and CancelBatch UDRs (see Batch-Based Real-Time Agents - UDR Types ). MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes The following MIM parameters are published at the agent level: MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Batch Cancelled This MIM parameter states if the current batch has been cancelled. Batch Cancelled is defined as a global MIM. Batch Count This MIM parameter contains a unique sequence number that will be associated with each batch processed by the workflow. This value is increased by 1 up to 2 63 and is saved between workflow invocations. Batch Count is defined as a global MIM. Batch Duration This MIM parameter contains the time it took to process a batch. This value is updated during processing. Batch Duration is defined as a global MIM. Batch End Time This MIM parameter contains the end time for the processing of a batch. Batch End Time is defined as a global MIM. Batch Start Time This MIM parameter contains the start time for the processing of a batch. Batch Start Time is defined as a global MIM. Transaction ID Each batch closed will receive a unique transaction ID, cancelled batches as well. This MIM parameter contains the unique transaction ID. Transaction ID is defined as a global MIM. Accesses The agent does not itself access any MIM resources.",
