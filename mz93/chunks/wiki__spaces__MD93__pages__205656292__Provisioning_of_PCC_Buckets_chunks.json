    "text": "There are three different interfaces for handling the provisioning of buckets, subscribers, and products. One is implemented as APL functions, the other as a REST web service, and the third is the regular user interface. Provisioning always targets a specific, internally predefined, area. Changes in one area are not reflected in the other. There are two different areas (TEST and PROD) the provisioning can target. A typical use case would be to provision data to the TEST area and, when considered ready, copy the content of TEST to PROD where a workflow can access them. Using two different areas - one for provisioning and one for runtime - makes it possible to test the configurations before moving them into production. This chapter includes the following sections: APL - PCC Provisioning Plugins - Buckets REST HTTP Interface - Buckets REST HTTP Interface - Products Provisioning Products for Buckets in Desktop",
