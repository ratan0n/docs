In the Analysis Agent, it maps Diameter requests to the configured UDR in the SQL processing agent, and then routes to the SQL forwarding agent to insert the data into a database. Upon commit, the SQL processing agent routes a commitUDR to the second Analysis agent. It then forms a Diameter Response UDR that is routed back to the Diameter Client.
