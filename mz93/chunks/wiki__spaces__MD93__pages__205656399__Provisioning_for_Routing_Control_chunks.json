    "text": "Provisioning of Routing Details, Routing Destinations, Route Mapping, and Use Cases is handled through APL functions or the Web UI. Provisioning always targets a specific, internally predefined, area. Changes in one area are not reflected in the other. There are two different areas (TEST and PROD) the provisioning can target. A typical use case would be to provision data to the TEST area and, when considered ready, copy the content of TEST to PROD where a workflow can access them. Using two different areas - one for provisioning and one for runtime - makes it possible to test the configurations before moving them into production.
