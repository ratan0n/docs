    "text": "The TCP/IP collection agent allows data to be collected and inserted into a workflow, using the standard TCP/IP protocol. Several connections at a time are allowed. It is also possible to send responses back to the source in the form of a bytearray, or in the case of several connections, as a UDR containing a response field. All response handling is done through APL commands. The TCP/IP collection agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Open A TCP/IP workflow may be configured to send responses to the source Upon activation, the collector binds to the defined port and awaits connections to be accepted. Note the absence of a Decoder in the workflows. The collector has built-in decoding functionality and supports any format as defined in the Ultra Format Editor . The section contains the following subsections: TCP/IP Related UDR Types TCP/IP Collection Agent Configuration The TCP/IP Format TCP/IP Collection Agent Input/Output Data and MIM TCP/IP Collection Agent Events",
