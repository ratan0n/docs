    "text": "To open the TCP/IP collection agent configuration, click Build  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type , select Realtime . Click Add agent and select Tcp Ip from the Agent Selection dialog. Double-click the agent icon or right-click the icon and select Edit agent , to display the Agent Configuration dialog. TCP/IP Tab Open TCP/IP collection agent configuration dialog - TCP/IP tab Setting Description Setting Description Host The IP address or hostname to which the TCP collector connects. If the host is connected the port must also be connected. If left empty, the TCP collector connects to all IP-addresses available in the system. Note! This setting can be dynamically updated. Port The port number from which the data is received. Make sure the port is not used by other applications. Note! The port can also be dynamically updated while the agent is running. Double-click the agent in the Workflow Editor in monitor mode and modify it. Save the workflow to trigger the agent to use the new port. For further information about updating agent configurations while a workflow is running, see Dynamic Update in Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Allow Multiple Connections Select this checkbox to allow several TCP/IP connections simultaneously. If cleared, only one connection is allowed. Number of Connections Allowed If Allow Multiple Connections is selected, enter a number between 2 and 65000 to specify the number of allowed connections. Send Response Select this checkbox to have the collector send a response back to the source. If Allow Multiple Connections is selected, the collector expects a UDR extended with the default TCPIPUDR as a reply. If the checkbox is cleared, it expects a bytearray. Note! Drag and drop in the opposite direction in the workflow to create a response route between the agents. The TCP/IP agent must be connected to an agent utilizing APL, since responses are created using APL commands. Open For a description of the differences between single or multiple connections, see A TCP/IP Example . Send TCPIPStateUDR Select this checkbox to track the connection state of the client and have the collection agent send a UDR indicating the status of the client connection each time it changes state. See TCPIPStateUDR in TCP/IP Related UDR Types . Note! This information is not detected if a client is powered down or if its network cable is removed. Decoder Tab The Decoder tab contains settings related to decoding of the collected data. Open TCP/IP collection agent configuration dialog - Decoder tab Extra System Properties This section describes the extra system properties that you can use to configure the TCP/IP Collection Agent. Setting Description Setting Description mz.tcpip.logginginterval_ms This property allows you to limit the number of exceptions from the TCP Collection Agent to one exception per specified interval (in milliseconds). Only change the property if support has expressly recommended it. It is normally not recommend to set this property.",
