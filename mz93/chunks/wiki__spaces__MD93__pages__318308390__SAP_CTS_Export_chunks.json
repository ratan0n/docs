    "text": "The CTS+ integration in MediationZone uses a \"loose coupling\" approach for handling exports. This means that the export process is performed within MediationZone , and then the exported file is manually made available to CTS+ for transport and import into target systems. To make a CTS+ export: Create the System Export: Use the System Export tool in Desktop, or the mzsh command line tool to generate the export file in MediationZone. Make the System Export available to TMS: Once the export file is created, follow the steps in the SAP CTS+ documentation on the SAP Help Portal - SAP Online Help to upload the file to TMS. When it is available, the export can be imported into target systems via the SAP CTS+ API. Note! When setting up your configurations and system exports, the entire export content will be imported into the target system. To ensure smooth integration we recommend that you: Use External References for system-specific variables. This ensures configurations are valid for both the source and target systems, with only the External References being system-specific. For more details, see External Reference Profile . Limit your exports to include only the use cases you intend to import into other systems.",
