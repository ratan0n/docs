    "text": "The threshold objects contain a set of level objects that define limits for the KPIs. When a limit is exceeded within a defined period, a threshold object and a level object are referenced in the KPIOutput UDRs. You can define the limit values for a threshold object in ascending or descending order. The following JSON schema describes the data format of the threshold object type: Loading The threshold object type has the following properties: Property Description orderDescending orderDescending controls in which order thresholds are evaluated and if alarms should be triggered when levels are exceeded from below or from above. Set this property to true for descending order and false for ascending order. levels levels must contain a set of level sub-objects, which describe the alert levels that are associated with a threshold object. The level object type contains the following properties: Property Description alarmDescription alarmDescription may contain an arbitrary string. value value must contain a numerical threshold value. A level object must have at least one level. Example - JSON Representation \"threshold\": { \"Region.AD\": { \"orderDescending\": true, \"levels\": { \"1\": { \"alarmDescription\": \"\", \"value\": 500 }, \"2\": { \"alarmDescription\": \"\", \"value\": 400 }, \"3\": { \"alarmDescription\": \"\", \"value\": 300 }, \"4\": { \"alarmDescription\": \"\", \"value\": 200 }, \"5\": { \"alarmDescription\": \"\", \"value\": 100 } } } } Break",
