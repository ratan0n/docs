For information on which function blocks are supported for each agent, see the relevant Python agent section. Some of the function blocks are applicable for all of the agents, while some are only relevant for Python agents in real-time workflows, and some for Python agents in batch workflows. Note! Function blocks are not relevant for the Python Connector agent. Top-level code such as global code and imported code will be executed just before the initialize function block. This section includes the following subsections: Function Blocks for Agents in Real-Time and Batch Workflows Function Blocks for Agents in Batch Workflows Function Blocks for Agents in Real-Time Workflows",
