    "text": "To send UDRs to the ECS, a workflow must contain an ECS forwarding agent and invalid UDRs have to be routed to it. It is recommended to use a preceding Analysis (or Aggregation) agent to associate an Error Code with the UDR. The ECS forwarding agent is applicable for UDRs only. Batches are handled through the cancelBatch functionality. Note! From the ECS forwarding agent, it is possible to pass on MIM values to be associated with the UDRs in the ECS Inspector. This section contains the following subsections: ECS Forwarding Agent Transaction Behavior, Input/Output Data, MIM, and Events ECS Forwarding Agent Configuration",
