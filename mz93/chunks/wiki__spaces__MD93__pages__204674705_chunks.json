    "text": "This section includes information about the SCP forwarding agent transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent does not emit anything. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents and based on them generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Begin Batch When a Begin Batch message is received, the temporary directory DR_TMP_DIR is first created in the target directory, if not already created. Then, a target file is created and opened in the temporary directory. End Batch When an End Batch message is received, the target file in DR_TMP_DIR is closed and, finally, the file is moved from the temporary directory to the target directory. If backlog functionality is enabled an additional step is taken where the file is moved from DR_TMP_DIR to DR_POSTPONED_MOVE_DIR and then to the target directory. If the last step failed the file will be left in DR_POSTPONED_MOVE_DIR. Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the target file is removed from the DR_TMP_DIR directory.",
