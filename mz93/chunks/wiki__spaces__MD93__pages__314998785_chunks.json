    "text": "In the Log Filter tool, you can edit log settings for the picos and update the logging dynamically. To view the Log Filter, go to Manage  Tools & Monitoring and then select Log Filter . Open Log Filter In Log Filter you have the following settings: Setting Description Setting Description Picos Select the pico(s) you want to update log settings for. If you select several picos, only one pico name will be displayed but you will see their names when hovering the number to the left of the pico. Refresh Click on this button to refresh the list of available picos. Some may have been added or removed since you opened the Log Filter. Reset Select this check box to remove all updated settings and revert to the default settings which are as follows: Stacktrace: ON Level: Set to the value of system property: pico.log.level Package: Any package/class. File: No additional file Stacktrace Select this check box to configure whether the stacktrace should be included in the log or not. Available options in the drop-down are ON and OFF . Level Select the lowest level of severity you want to log in this drop-down; ERROR , WARN , INFO , CONFIG , DEBUG , TRACE , FINEST . You can also select ALL to log all events regardless of severity, and OFF to stop all logging for the selected picos . Caution! If you set a detailed log level, such as DEBUG, TRACE, or FINEST, logging will be done for all classes in the selected pico(s), including APL logging, which may have a negative impact on performance. To avoid excessive logging when using these log levels, you can select the Package check box, described below, and enter a package, for example, aplLogger to only do logging for APL. Package Select this check box to only log events for a specific *.mzp package or class. Specify the package name or class in the field to the right. This setting can be useful if you have built your own DTK packages, or if you need help from support. Note! When you use the Package option and state aplLogger, you can also specify a specific workflow by appending it like this: aplLogger.<workflow name>. File Select this check box to send logging an additional file with the filename specified in the field to the right. If you only select this check box and nothing else, the same logging will be done in both the regular log files and the additional file, but if you make any other log settings and select this check box, the other setting will only be applied for the logging in the additional file and not for the regular logging. Update Click on this button to apply your changes to the log settings for the selected pico(s). Clear Click on this button to clear all settings you have made.",
