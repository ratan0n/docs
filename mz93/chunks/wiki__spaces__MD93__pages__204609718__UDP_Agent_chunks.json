    "text": "The UDP collection agent allows data to be collected and inserted into a workflow, using the standard UDP protocol. It is also possible to send responses back to the source in the form of a bytearray or in the case of several connections as a UDR containing a response field. All response handling is done through APL commands. The UDP collection agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments. This section describes the UDP collection agent. The agent is listed among the collection agents. Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: The UDP protocol, RFC 768 Supported Protocol Specification The UDP protocol has been implemented according to RFC 768.

Note the absence of a Decoder in the workflows. The collector has built-in decoding functionality, supporting any format as defined in the Ultra Format Editor . The section contains the following subsections: The UDP Format UDP Related UDR Types UDP Agent Configuration UDP Agent Input/Output Data and MIM UDP Agent Events",
