    "text": "TCPIPUDR The TCPIPUDR is the UDR type created by default in the TCPIP agent. It can be viewed in the UDR Internal Format Browser . To open the browser click Build  New Configuration  APL Code . In the editing area right-click and select UDR Assistance... to open the UDR Internal Format Browser . Open TCPIPUDR Field Description Field Description RemoteIP(ipaddress) The IP address of the client. RemotePort(int) The port through which the agent connects to the client. response(bytearray) The data that the agent sends back to the client. SequenceNumber(long) A per-connection unique number that is generated by the TCPIP agent. This number enables you to follow the order by which the UDRs are collected. The agent counter is reset whenever connection with the agent is established. The UDR fields RemoteIP , RemotePort , and SequenceNumber are accessible from the workflow configuration only if the TCP/IP agent is configured with a decoder that extends the built-in TCP/IP format. For further information see Decoder in the section Decoder Tab in TCP/IP Collection Agent Configuration . The TCPIPUDR cannot be cloned and the socket connection is not initialized if cloning is attempted. It is therefore recommended that you initialize every UDR from the decoder, and then route it into the workflow. TCPIPStateUDR You can configure the collection agent to track the connection state of the client. Whenever the client is connected or disconnected, the agent sends this UDR which contains the status of the connection each time it changes state. To activate this function, go to the TCP/IP tab and select the Send TCPIPStateUDR checkbox. See the TCP/IP Tab in TCP/IP Collection Agent Configuration . Open TCPIPStateUDR Field Description Field Description data (bytearray) This field is only populated when the collection agent tries to send a response to the client but the client is no longer connected. The agent then sends the TCPIPStateUDR back to the workflow with isConnected = false , and also including the response that APL wanted to send. During a normal state change, the value in the data field is null . ipAddress (string) The IP address of the client. isConnected (boolean) This field indicates if the client is connected or disconnected. When there is a new connection, this field is set to true . When a connection is terminated or disconnected, this field is set to false . port (int) The port of the client. response(bytearray) The data that the agent sends back to the client.",
