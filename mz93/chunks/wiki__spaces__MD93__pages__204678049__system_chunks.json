    "text": "usage: system <subcommand> <options> This command starts the Platform if it is not running, and then starts/stops pico instances on containers that have been set up for remote execution. Note! This command is valid only for the MZ_HOME owner. You can specify which pico instances that are to be started, stopped, or restarted by adding a target path to the subcommands. The target path is specified as follows: container:<container>/pico:<pico> or container:<container> Note! Set your desired environment variables in $MZ_HOME/bin/mzshr.env as this file will be loaded with local variables. Add the desired profiles, such as \". /home/mzadmin/.profile_mz\". You can specify both the container and pico instance as a regular expression. Example - Regular expression in target paths container:.*/pico:.* By adding tag attributes you can perform additional filtering of the pico instances: Example - Adding tags to pico instances $ mzsh topo set -l pico:ec1 'settings.tags=[tag1,tag2]' $ mzsh topo set -l pico:ec2 'settings.tags=[tag1]' Run the following command to start the pico instances with the tag tag1 . $ mzsh system start -t tag1 The following subcommands are available with mzsh system : help restart start stop help Usage: system help [<subcommand>] Use system help to retrieve a description of the help command or its subcommands. Run the following command for an overview of the various subcommands: $ mzsh system help Run the following command for a description of a specific subcommand: $ mzsh system help <command> restart Usage: system restart [--dry-run] [-l, --local] [-services] [-t, --tag <tag>] [--timeout-seconds] [-v, --verbose] [<target path>] Use system restart to stop and start pico instances in one or more containers. The Platform will be started if it is not already running. However, the command does not stop the Platform. Option Description Option Description [--dry-run] Lists the picos instances that are addressed by the command, but the command is not executed. [-l, --local] Use this option to select the local container, unless another container is specified in the target path. [-t, --tag <tag>] Filter that excludes all pico instances that do not contain the specified tag. [--timeout-seconds] Sets the maximum allowed time for all calls to complete. The default value is 300 seconds. [-v, --verbose] Use this option for detailed output from the command. start Usage: system start [--dry-run] [-l, --local] [-t, --tag <tag>] [--timeout-seconds] [-v, --verbose] Use system start to start pico instances in one or more containers. The Platform will be started if it is not already running. Option Description Option Description [--dry-run] Lists the picos instances that are addressed by the command, but the command is not executed. [-l, --local] Use this option to select the local container, unless another container is specified in the target path. [-t, --tag <tag>] Includes pico instances in the target path that contain the specified tag. [--timeout-seconds] Sets the maximum allowed time for all calls to complete. The default value is 300 seconds. [-v, --verbose] Use this option for detailed output from the command. stop Usage: system stop [--dry-run] [-t, --tag <tag>] [--timeout-seconds] [-v, --verbose] [<target path>] Use system stop to stop pico instances in one or more containers. Option Description Option Description [--dry-run] Lists the picos instances that are addressed by the command, but the command is not executed. [-l, --local] Use this option to select the local container, unless another container is specified in the target path. -t, --tag <tag>] Includes pico instances in the target path that contain the specified tag. [--timeout-seconds] Sets the maximum allowed time for all calls to complete. The default value is 300 seconds. [-v, --verbose] Use this option for detailed output from the command. Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the system command: Code Description Code Description -1 Will be returned if there is an old process running or if the remote (../temp/.remote) file cannot be deleted. 0 Will be returned if the command was successful, or if there are no startable processes defined. 1 Will be returned if the JVM fails to start. (The JVM has logged too much on stderr.) 102 Will be returned if the JVM fails to start. (The timeout on the callback from the JVM was exceeded.) 103 Will be returned if the command has been interrupted with CTRL-C. 104 Will be returned if the JVM fails to start. (The JVM started with one or more critical errors.)",
