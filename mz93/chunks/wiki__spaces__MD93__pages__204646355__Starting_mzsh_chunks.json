When the command is executed, the command prompt is returned to the Unix shell. The standard input can be passed to mzsh using the standard unix command xargs . This means that commands that are meant to be executed can be included in a script file or simply let other commands produce the commands for it, see the following example. Example - Non-interactive mode $ while read wf ; do echo $wf done < my-wfs.list | xargs mzsh mzadmin/<password> wfstart The command in the example reads the names of the workflows included in the file my-wfs.list and generates start commands for each of them. The output of this action is then fed from standard input as arguments to mzsh .",
