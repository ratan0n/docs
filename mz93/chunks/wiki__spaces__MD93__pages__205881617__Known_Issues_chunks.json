    "text": "Open In MediationZone 9.3, there are the following known issues: 1 Installation and Upgrade Issues 1.1 Unable to Change Platform Database After Installation 1.2 Installation is Reported as Successful Even if the Platform Fails to Start 1.3 Warning Messages Displayed During Installation 1.4 Error Occurs When Performing Multiple Installations on a Host with Different UNIX User IDs 1.5 Configuration History Loss After Upgrade from MediationZone 8 1.6 Deleted Configuration History Unavailable After Upgrade from MediationZone 8 1.7 Only the first EC is started when multiple ECs are specified 2 User Interface issues 2.1 New Desktop Issues 2.1.1 Database Agent Assignment Tab Value Are Not Cleared 2.1.2 Database Agent MIM Browser Need To Click Twice To Close It 2.1.3 External Reference Profile Datalist Can Be Altered in Read-Only Mode 2.1.4 Login Web UI Will Go To Last Page That Last User Accessed 2.1.5 Type Assigned Indication not Shown in MIM Browser 2.1.6 Idle Timeout Only Warns the User Once 2.1.7 Data Veracity Repair Jobs Show in One Line 2.2 Accessibility Issues 2.3 Code Editor Issues 2.4 Known Differences Between Desktops 3 Data Veracity issues 3.1 Data Veracity Search Filtering For Some Fields Are Case-Sensitive 3.2 Data Veracity Filter's Full Query Is Not Available on Desktop 3.3 Adding an Empty Query Group With A Parent Condition In Data Veracity Search & Repair Filter Will Result In An Error 3.4 Importing Old Data Veracity Collection Agent Workflow Configurations Returned Validation Errors 3.5 Data Veracity Filters Are Not Refreshed Automatically 3.6 Data Veracity New Restricted Fields That Were Used For An Existing Repair Rule Is Not Disabled 3.7 Data Veracity Not Working Well in Workflow Packages 4 Duplicate UDR issues 4.1 Duplicate UDR Inspector Stuck Loading When Attempting To Delete Records 4.2 System Log Shows Unknown User On Deleting A Record In Duplicate UDR Inspector 4.3 Duplicate UDR Inspector Allows To Delete Records Without Profile Locking 4.4 Duplicate UDR Inspector Didnt Return Records Properly 4.5 Duplicate UDR MIMs Shows 0 4.6 Incorrect Handling When Duplicate UDR Process Old Data With System Arrival Time 4.7 Duplicate UDR Inspector Table Header Row Count Is Not Updated When Records Found Is 0 4.8 Rename Duplicate UDR Profile Doesnt Auto Reflect In Duplicate UDR Agent 4.9 Exception Thrown When Truncating Previous Tables After Changing DB Profile In Duplicate UDR Profile 4.10 File Directory Is Not Empty When Delete Duplicate UDR File Storage Profile 5 Reference Data Management 5.1 Reference Data Management Table Shows No Data And All Functions Are Locked 5.2 Import/Export Ongoing Process Are Not Aborted When Navigating Away From Reference Data Management 6 SAPCC Rest Agent 6.1 Unable To Add Additional Parameter In Desktop Online Workflow Page 6.2 Workflow Unable To Rollback To Default Values 7 Other issues 7.1 Logging Issue 7.2 Error Thrown When SAPCC Agent Not Added With Any Host 7.3 Inappropriate Validation Handling On Workflow Group Scheduling 7.4 Database Forwarding Agent Validation Message 7.5 External References Can Be Removed when a Workflow is Dependent on It 7.6 Keystore Information Is Gone After Imported Notification Workflow From MZ8.3 7.7 Overwrite After Collection Disabled in Workflow Table of Workflow Properties 7.8 ECS Tables Missing Indexes 7.9 SAP RFC Workflow Hangs when Setting Date Data Type 7.10 ORA-1000 For Oracle Database 7.11 Incorrect OpenAPI Specifications in Operations REST Interface Installation and Upgrade Issues Unable to Change Platform Database After Installation It is not possible to change platform database after the installation is completed which used to be a feature that available since 8.x. This issue will be fixed in future releases. Installation is Reported as Successful Even if the Platform Fails to Start In some circumstances during installation the installer may report as successful when the platform has not started. Warning Messages Displayed During Installation When the user performs  setup.sh prepare , a warning message  setSecurityManager will be removed in a future release \" is displayed. This does not impact functionality of MZ 9 installation and will be handled in future versions of MZ. Error Occurs When Performing Multiple Installations on a Host with Different UNIX User IDs The /tmp/syslog/syslog-debug.log file is created when a host machine contains an MZ 9 installation. This file will be overwritten by any subsequent MZ 9 installations that are performed on the same host machine with a different UNIX user ID. However, the attempt to overwrite this file will fail and cause errors to the subsequent installations. To solve this issue, modify the platform.xml file setting by using the mzsh topo open platform command. Edit the platform.xml file, and change the directory to use another directory using the following command: <property name=\"mz.syslog.debuglogfile.filedir\" value=\"[the directory]\"/> . Configuration History Loss After Upgrade from MediationZone 8 After upgrading from MediationZone 8, existing configuration history will no longer be available. This issue will be fixed in future releases. Deleted Configuration History Unavailable After Upgrade from MediationZone 8 After upgrading from MediationZone 8, previously deleted configuration history in MediationZone 8 is no longer accessible in the Configuration Tracer. This issue will be fixed in future releases. Only the first EC is started when multiple ECs are specified When specifying multiple ECs during installation using a comma-delimited format (e.g., ec1,ec2,ec3), the installation completes successfully. However, only the first EC (ec1) is started post-installation. The remaining ECs are not started as expected. User Interface issues New Desktop Issues Database Agent Assignment Tab Value Are Not Cleared When Value Type is set to \"To UDR\" or \"NULL\", the Value column are not cleared. Database Agent MIM Browser Need To Click Twice To Close It The MIM browser open from database agent, need to close it by hitting twice on cancel button or the X button to close it. External Reference Profile Datalist Can Be Altered in Read-Only Mode When certain procedures are made, it is possible to alter the data list found in the external reference profile while the read-only mode is used. This causes a system-wide DRRCPException to be thrown. Login Web UI Will Go To Last Page That Last User Accessed User A log out from web UI, and User B login, it will automatically go to the page last accessed by User A. Type Assigned Indication not Shown in MIM Browser This can be viewed in the Legacy Desktop if required. Idle Timeout Only Warns the User Once Inactive users will be logged out after a configurable period, following a warning to that effect. If a user is active after the warning they won't be logged out, but if they are inactive again then they will be logged out with no warning. Data Veracity Repair Jobs Show in One Line When viewing the repair jobs in the new UI they are displayed in one line which is hard to read. Accessibility Issues The new web-native desktop aims to be fully accessible, but there are currently some outstanding issues regarding this. These include: In some interfaces, the keyboard navigation doesn't follow the ideal order or convention Incorrect behavior of radio buttons Code Editor Issues The code editor in the desktop provides code completion and syntax highlighting there are some known issues with syntax highlighting not being correct, it is not possible to add tabs to code and code completion cannot be activated on a Mac if multiple keyboard layouts are enabled. When attempting to use the code completion function in agents or profiles, for example, the Analysis agent , the built-in keyboard shortcut of Command + Space on a Mac computer will not trigger the code completion dialog box. Known Differences Between Desktops There are some known, minor issues with differences between the two Desktops. Data Veracity issues Data Veracity Search Filtering For Some Fields Are Case-Sensitive The filtering for the source_node and message fields in the Data Veracity Search & Repair table are case-sensitive. Data Veracity Filter's Full Query Is Not Available on Desktop The full filter query for Data Veracity is not available for viewing on the Desktop. A partial display of the query can be seen in the filter listing under Data Veracity > Filter listing. Open Adding an Empty Query Group With A Parent Condition In Data Veracity Search & Repair Filter Will Result In An Error Attempting to add an empty query group with a parent condition will cause an error to be thrown upon clicking OK . A sample of the query setup is shown below. Open Importing Old Data Veracity Collection Agent Workflow Configurations Returned Validation Errors If you have an old Data Veracity Collection Agent Workflow configuration from version 8.x, it is possible that validation errors about invalid Analysis Agents may occur. Example error during import: The following agents returned validation errors. Analysis_1 is invalid. The UDR type DataVeracityUDR (DataVeracity) doesn't exist Example error when viewing the invalid workflow Analysis Agent configuration: Error: Failed to set UDR Types Message: Unable to create UDR type description from DataVeracityUDR (DataVeracity). To resolve this, you will need to re-add the Data Veracity UDR for Analysis Agent input UDR Types or use the Set To Input button if applicable. After adding the appropriate Analysis UDR Types, save the workflow configuration. Data Veracity Filters Are Not Refreshed Automatically The Filter page is not always the latest, after creating a new Filter from the Data Veracity Search page, you may need to click the Refresh button to view it. Data Veracity New Restricted Fields That Were Used For An Existing Repair Rule Is Not Disabled If setting a new restricted field that was used in a previously created Repair Rule, it is expected that the rule on the said field should be grayed out when viewing the saved Repair Rule and be ignored when applying repair tasks. This is not the case as the rule on the said field still appears to be editable in the old Saved Repair Rule. Data Veracity Not Working Well in Workflow Packages There are classloading issues in both inspectors and for Data Veracity it is not even possible to access the data since the profile is not selectable. For both ECS Inspector and DV Inspector, it is impossible to view the UDRs containing the Request (generated from Diameter Application Profile) due to classloading issues. Duplicate UDR issues Duplicate UDR Inspector Stuck Loading When Attempting To Delete Records When a Duplicate UDR profile is being used by a running workflow, attempting to delete any records for that profile in Duplicate UDR Inspector would cause the Inspector to be stuck loading. System Log Shows Unknown User On Deleting A Record In Duplicate UDR Inspector After deleting any records in Duplicate UDR Inspector, the log message in the System Log, will show the Username as <Unknown>. Duplicate UDR Inspector Allows To Delete Records Without Profile Locking Currently, when executing a workflow using the Duplicate UDR profile, the profile remains unlocked, allowing for the deletion of records from the Duplicate UDR Inspector. Duplicate UDR Inspector Didnt Return Records Properly With certain search date criteria in Duplicate UDR Inspector, some records are not returned. Duplicate UDR MIMs Shows 0 Duplicate UDR Inspector shows these MIMs as 0 even when there are Duplicate UDR caught. Dup_UDR_1.dups UDRs Dup_UDR_1.Inbound UDRs Dup_UDR_1.Outbound UDRs Dup_UDR_1.r_3 UDRs Incorrect Handling When Duplicate UDR Process Old Data With System Arrival Time With the SQL Storage Duplicate UDR profile set to use System Arrival Time , UDRs with dates older than the system time on the Platform will not be handled properly. The Duplicate UDR Inspector will not display any data despite the UDRs being processed. When using File Storage Duplicate UDR profile with System Arrival Time as well, you might see Records and Duplicates as 0 in the legacy desktop Duplicate UDR Inspector. Duplicate UDR Inspector Table Header Row Count Is Not Updated When Records Found Is 0 When searching a profile that has no records after previously searching with a profile that has any records, the table header would still display previous row count. Rename Duplicate UDR Profile Doesnt Auto Reflect In Duplicate UDR Agent When renaming a Duplicate UDR profile in the configuration browser, the Duplicate UDR agent that is using this profile is does not refresh with the new name automatically. This does not affect the workflow when executing with the profile. Exception Thrown When Truncating Previous Tables After Changing DB Profile In Duplicate UDR Profile Upon saving a copy of Duplicate UDR profile A to another Duplicate UDR profile. Changing the DB profile to a different schema and clicking on Yes at the confirmation message to truncate previous tables would lead to an exception error. File Directory Is Not Empty When Delete Duplicate UDR File Storage Profile When deleting a Duplicate UDR File Storage profile and choosing Yes to delete relational data, the system will fail to empty the File Directory. Reference Data Management Reference Data Management Table Shows No Data And All Functions Are Locked After searching in Reference Data Management with any number of results on the table, navigate away from Reference Data Management to another page. Navigate back to Reference Data Management and click on Get Started. Once the Query dialog is opened, refresh the page, and click on Query to select the same profile and table and the apply, you would find that table is now empty, and all functions are locked. Import/Export Ongoing Process Are Not Aborted When Navigating Away From Reference Data Management Running import/export processes are not aborted when navigating away from the Reference Data Management page. SAPCC Rest Agent Unable To Add Additional Parameter In Desktop Online Workflow Page In Desktop Online Add/Edit Workflow page, click on the Add button for Additional Parameters field, we will see the pop up missing Key and Value fields, so currently user is unable to add Additional Parameters in Workflow page. However, user can add Additional Parameters in Legacy Desktop. Workflow Unable To Rollback To Default Values Set agent fields to Default in Workflow Properties, and enter some data into lets say a textfield and save it. Then edit again to remove data in this textfield, workflow template will throws validation error that the workflow is invalid. This happened to checkbox and some other fields as well. Other issues Logging Issue When logging out of the legacy desktop desktop_current.log has unnecessary logs added Error Thrown When SAPCC Agent Not Added With Any Host In the SAP CC Batch agent, do not add any host, click the Save As button, and you will find the error shown below: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"String.matches(String)\" because \"hosts\" is null Inappropriate Validation Handling On Workflow Group Scheduling In Workflow Group Scheduling, when adding a duplicate execution day plan, it prompts the wrong validation message content and if the user continues to save, scheduling data will be wiped off. Database Forwarding Agent Validation Message In Database Forwarding Agent, when we have a field NULL/To UDR, the validation message that prompted does not properly describe the problem. External References Can Be Removed when a Workflow is Dependent on It External references of the type Database Properties can be removed even if they are in use. Any workflows using these references will become invalid. Keystore Information Is Gone After Imported Notification Workflow From MZ8.3 System Import Notification Workflow from MZ8.3, found that Keystore information in the SAP CC Notification agent is gone. Overwrite After Collection Disabled in Workflow Table of Workflow Properties Users might encounter this issue when using a workflow configuration that uses SFTP Agent exported from MediationZone versions prior to MediationZone 9.3.0.4. This impacts SFTP Agents configured with the Default Collection Strategy and with the After Collection option set to either Move To or Rename. This issue occurs for workflow configurations that have not been modified since import. To resolve this, edit the workflow configuration (e.g. move an agent slightly) and then save the configuration. The Overwrite After Collection workflow property will now be configurable. ECS Tables Missing Indexes ECS Tables have found some indexes were missing during the migration from mz8 to mz9. We are planning to add it back in MZ 9.4.0.0 which will be release at 28th April 2025. Follow by MZ 9.3.2.0 SAP RFC Workflow Hangs when Setting Date Data Type Users may encounter suspended workflows when setting SAP RFC functions with the Date data type using the SAP Java Connector (JCo) library release 3.1.4. This issue happens specifically with the handling of date fields. It is recommended to upgrade to SAP Java Connector (JCo) library release 3.1.11 or later to avoid this issue. The newer releases contain fixes that prevent the workflow from hanging when handling Date data types. ORA-1000 For Oracle Database You will encounter an ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded error for versions 9.3.0.0 onwards until 9.3.0.4 and 9.3.1.3 when using MediationZone with Oracle database. The issue is fixed in MediationZone versions 9.3.0.4 and 9.3.1.3 onwards. Incorrect OpenAPI Specifications in Operations REST Interface The OpenAPI specification files generated for the Operations REST Interface contain inaccuracies. This affects the following endpoints: http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/wf/v1/openapi.yaml  Workflows API http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/wfg/v1/openapi.yaml  Workflow Groups API http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/extref/v1/openapi.yaml  External References API http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/host/v1/openapi.yaml - Host API http(s)://<platform server>:<platform port>/ops/mz/pico/v1/openapi.yaml - Pico API These inaccuracies may lead to failed validation when creating an Open API Profile based on the provided OpenAPI specification. The issue will be fixed in MediationZone 9.4.0.0.",
