    "text": "To shut down workflow groups, workflows and Desktops: Open Execution Manager , and check the status of all Workflow Groups groups (Enabled / Disabled). This step is necessary to identify which groups need to be resumed after the upgrade is completed. If there is a mix of enabled and disabled groups, make sure to record all  Enabled  groups, as you will need this information during the Resume Workflow Execution process. Otherwise if all groups are enabled, you can proceed to the next step. Note! Make sure to check the status of System Task-related groups to determine if they also need to be resumed after the upgrade. The Workflow Groups can be disabled using either the Execution Manager in Desktop or via the command line. The example below shows how to disable all Workflow Groups via command line wfgroupdisable . $ mzsh mzadmin/<password> wfgroupdisable * Stop all workflows that are not disconnected and let them finish execution. Ensure that all users shut down all connected Desktops. If you want to see which Desktops that are connected, you can use the following command: $ mzsh mzadmin/<password> pico -view Note! This command will also display other pico instances, such as Execution Contexts.",
