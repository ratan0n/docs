    "text": "This appendix contains descriptions of the profiles that are not related to specific agents. Agent-specific profiles are described in the documentation of the respective agents. Parameterizable Profile Fields To make profiles reusable in an efficient way, some of them support a concept called Parameterizable Fields. Such fields makes it possible to have one configuration only, reusable both in development, test, and production systems. It also makes it easy to add support in CI/CD pipelines. For instructions on how to define basic parameters, refer to External Reference Profile . A parameterizable profile field can be used as a template and its value can be set per workflow. The parameter s ynt ax is ${category.name}. By using this syntax, a Dynamic Fields Tab of type string is created. The value of the field is set as a workflow parameter and the value will be replaced when the workflow is executed. Profile fields supporting parameterization are marked with a $(dollar sign) icon. Currently, the following profiles support use of parameterization: 5G Profile Couchbase Profile File System Profile Kafka Profile This chapter contains the following sections: 5G Profile Audit Profile Azure KeyVault Profile Couchbase Profile Database Profile Distributed Storage Profile Elasticsearch Profile External Reference Profile File System Profile Google Secret Manager Profile IPDR SP Template Profile Open API Profile Redis Profile Secrets Profile Security Profile Shared Table Profile",
