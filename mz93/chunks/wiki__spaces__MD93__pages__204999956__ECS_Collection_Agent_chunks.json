    "text": "The Error Correction System (ECS) collection agent fetches data sent to the internal ECS by workflows configured to do so. Data is sent to the ECS as UDRs or batches. In the latter case, error UDRs may be associated with batches containing the relevant information. When collected by an ECS collection agent, the fields in the UDRs are included as MIM values in the workflow. Open Example of a workflow collecting UDRs from the ECS If batches are collected, the ECS Collection agent produces bytearray data. To determine which UDRs/batches to collect, select a Reprocessing Group (defined in the ECS Inspector). It is only possible to have one active ECS collection workflow per Reprocessing Group at a time. Note! Collecting UDRs from the ECS only changes their states, they are not physically removed from the ECS. Use the predefined system task ECS_Maintenance to automatically remove UDRs. For further information, see ECS Maintenance System Task . You can also manually delete UDRs directly from the ECS Inspector.
