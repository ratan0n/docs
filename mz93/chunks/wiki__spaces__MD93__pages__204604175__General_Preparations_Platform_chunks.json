    "text": "A UNIX user must be created to execute the installation and run the MediationZone instance. Preferably create the user mzadmin , which is referenced throughout this document. Important! The mzadmin user must have read/write permissions for all the directories stated in the Environment Variables. To avoid security risks, do not use the root user in place of the mzadmin user for the application. For security reasons, ensure that the read/write/execute permissions for $MZ_HOME directory and sub-folders are given only to authorized users or user groups to prevent unauthorized access to any of the system files. During the installation procedure, the default application user , mzadmin , is automatically created - note that this is not related to the OS user or the DB user. You cannot create or use other application users than this default user until after the installation is complete. MediationZone should always be administrated by users belonging to the access groups created in MediationZone. See Access Controller for more information on how to create users and access groups. The final part of the general preparations is to ensure that the necessary third party products are installed, which are the required Java version, the platform database to be used (Oracle, PostgreSQL, SAP HANA, or Derby) and any additional software required by various parts of the system. See System Requirements for more information.
