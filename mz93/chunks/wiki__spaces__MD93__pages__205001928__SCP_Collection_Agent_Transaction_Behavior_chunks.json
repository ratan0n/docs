    "text": "This section includes information about the SCP collection agent transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Workflow Monitor . Input/Output Data The agent transmits commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Begin Batch Will be emitted just before the first byte of each collected file is fed into a workflow. End Batch Will be emitted just after the last byte of each collected file has been fed into the system. The agent acquires commands from other agents and based on them generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch to ECS. Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on the workflow level is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will never receive the last Cancel Batch message. In this situation, ECS will not be involved, and the file will not be moved, however, left at its current place. APL code where Hint End Batch is followed by a Cancel Batch will always result in workflow abort. Make sure to design the APL code to first evaluate the Cancel Batch criteria to avoid this sort of behavior. Hint End Batch If a Hint End Batch message is received, the collector splits the batch at the end of the currently processed block (as received from the server), provided that no UDR is split. If the block end occurs within a UDR, the batch will be split at the end of the preceding UDR. After a batch split, the collector emits an End Batch Message, followed by a Begin Batch message (provided that there is more data in the subsequent block).",
