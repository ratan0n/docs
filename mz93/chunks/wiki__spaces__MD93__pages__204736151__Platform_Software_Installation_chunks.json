    "text": "The final step in the Platform Container installation must be executed as the mzadmin UNIX user. The following command session sets up the directory structure and installs all the software. The release content directory is the working directory for the installation. To install the software: Enter the release content directory: $ cd ./<staging directory>/<release content directory> Pre-installation validations are performed to verify the environment and configuration, ensuring a seamless installation experience. To perform validation without starting the installation, run the following command: $ ./setup.sh install -validate-only Run the following command to initiate the installation process. $ ./setup.sh install The Platform is automatically started and shut down during the installation. Note! If the Platform failed to start, check the platform.log file in $MZ_HOME/log for details. If validation fails but you choose to proceed, you can run the following command: $ ./setup.sh install -skip-validate Caution! You can choose to skip validation, but be aware that this bypasses checks for potential issues in your environment and configuration. If there are undetected problems, the installation may fail or cause unexpected behavior. Proceed with caution and ensure you have backups before continuing. Start the Platform: $ mzsh startup platform The installation of the Platform Container is now complete.",
