If you encounter permission errors, see configure Claude Code for recommended solutions. 2 Navigate to your project cd your-project-directory 3 Start Claude Code claude 4 Complete authentication Claude Code offers multiple authentication options: Anthropic Console : The default option. Connect through the Anthropic Console and complete the OAuth process. Requires active billing at console.anthropic.com . Claude App (with Pro or Max plan) : Subscribe to Claudes Pro or Max plan for a unified subscription that includes both Claude Code and the web interface. Get more value at the same price point while managing your account in one place. Log in with your Claude.ai account. During launch, choose the option that matches your subscription type. Enterprise platforms : Configure Claude Code to use Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI for enterprise deployments with your existing cloud infrastructure.  Initialize your project For first-time users, we recommend: 1 Start Claude Code claude 2 Run a simple command > summarize this project 3 Generate a CLAUDE.md project guide /init 4 Commit the generated CLAUDE.md file Ask Claude to commit the generated CLAUDE.md file to your repository.  Troubleshooting  Troubleshooting WSL installation Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL. You might encounter the following issues in WSL: OS/platform detection issues : If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows npm . Try: Run npm config set os linux before installation Install with npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check (Do NOT use sudo ) Node not found errors : If you see exec: node: not found when running claude , your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with which npm and which node , which should point to Linux paths starting with /usr/ rather than /mnt/c/ . To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distributions package manager or via nvm .  Optimize your terminal setup Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience. Supported shells : Bash Zsh Fish  Themes and appearance Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. Thats handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Codes theme to your terminal during onboarding or any time via the /config command  Line breaks You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code: Quick escape : Type  followed by Enter to create a newline Keyboard shortcut : Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper configuration To set up Option+Enter in your terminal: For Mac Terminal.app: Open Settings  Profiles  Keyboard Check Use Option as Meta Key For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal: Open Settings  Profiles  Keys Under General, set Left/Right Option key to Esc+ Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users : Run /terminal-setup within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.  Notification setup Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:  Terminal bell notifications Enable sound alerts when tasks complete: claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell For macOS users : Dont forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings  Notifications  [Your Terminal App].  iTerm 2 system notifications For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete: Open iTerm 2 Preferences Navigate to Profiles  Terminal Enable Silence bell and Filter Alerts  Send escape sequence-generated alerts Set your preferred notification delay Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.  Handling large inputs When working with extensive code or long instructions: Avoid direct pasting : Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content Use file-based workflows : Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it Be aware of VS Code limitations : The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes  Vim Mode Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with /vim or configured via /config . The supported subset includes: Mode switching: Esc (to NORMAL), i / I , a / A , o / O (to INSERT) Navigation: h / j / k / l , w / e / b , 0 / $ /  , gg / G Editing: x , dw / de / db / dd / D , cw / ce / cb / cc / C , .
