This allows you to route all Claude Code traffic through your organizations proxy servers for security, compliance, and monitoring purposes.  Basic proxy configuration  Environment variables Claude Code respects standard proxy environment variables: export HTTPS_PROXY = https://proxy.example.com:8080 export HTTP_PROXY = http://proxy.example.com:8080 Claude Code currently does not support the NO_PROXY environment variable. All traffic will be routed through the configured proxy. Claude Code does not support SOCKS proxies.  Authentication  Basic authentication If your proxy requires basic authentication, include credentials in the proxy URL: export HTTPS_PROXY = http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080 Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage instead. For proxies requiring advanced authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, etc.), consider using an LLM Gateway service that supports your authentication method.  SSL certificate issues If your proxy uses custom SSL certificates, you may encounter certificate errors. Ensure that you set the correct certificate bundle path: export SSL_CERT_FILE = /path/to/certificate-bundle.crt export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = /path/to/certificate-bundle.crt  Network access requirements Claude Code requires access to the following URLs: api.anthropic.com - Claude API endpoints statsig.anthropic.com - Telemetry and metrics sentry.io - Error reporting Ensure these URLs are allowlisted in your proxy configuration and firewall rules. This is especially important when using Claude Code in containerized or restricted network environments.
