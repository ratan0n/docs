This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.\nThe right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!\nSystem prompt tips\n: Use the\nsystem\nparameter to set Claude’s role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the\nuser\nturn instead.\n​\nWhy use role prompting?\nEnhanced accuracy:\nIn complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.\nTailored tone:\nWhether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.\nImproved focus:\nBy setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.\n​\nHow to give Claude a role\nUse the\nsystem\nparameter in the\nMessages API\nto set Claude’s role:\nimport\nanthropic\nclient\n=\nanthropic\n.\nAnthropic\n(\n)\nresponse\n=\nclient\n.\nmessages\n.\ncreate\n(\nmodel\n=\n\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\"\n,\nmax_tokens\n=\n2048\n,\nsystem\n=\n\"You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.\"\n,\n# <-- role prompt\nmessages\n=\n[\n{\n\"role\"\n:\n\"user\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>\"\n}\n]\n)\nprint\n(\nresponse\n.\ncontent\n)\nRole prompting tip\n: Experiment with roles!

Indemnification (Section 8):\n- We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.\n2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):\n- Damages capped at $500.\n3. IP Ownership (Section 12):\n- We retain ownership of our modifications.\nOverall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights.\nWith a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:\nLegal contract analysis with role prompting\nRole\nContent\nUser\nYou are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:\n<contract>\n{{CONTRACT}}\n</contract>\nAnalyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion.\nAssistant\nI’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:\n1. Indemnification (Section 8):\n- Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.\n- Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.\n- Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.\n2. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):\n- Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.\n- Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.\n- Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.\n3. IP Ownership (Section 12):\n- Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.\n- Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.\n- Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.\nProfessional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains.\n​\nExample 2: Financial analysis\nWithout a role, Claude’s analysis lacks depth:\nFinancial analysis without role prompting\nRole\nContent\nUser\nAnalyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:\n<data>\n{{FINANCIALS}}\n</data>\nHighlight key trends and recommend actions.\nAssistant\nHere’s a summary of your Q2 financials:\n1. Revenue: $15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.\n2. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.\n3. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&D investments.\n4. Cash Flow: $4.1M operating, $28M in reserves.\nOverall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course.\nWith a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:\nFinancial analysis with role prompting\nRole\nContent\nUser\nYou are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We’re in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:\n<data>\n{{FINANCIALS}}\n</data>\nAnalyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate.\nAssistant\nBoard members, here’s my analysis of our Q2 financials:\n1. Revenue ($15.2M, +22% YoY):\n- Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.\n- Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.\n- Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.\n2. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):\n- Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.\n- Flag: R&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.\n- Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.\n3. Cash ($4.1M OCF, $28M reserves):\n- Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.\n- Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.\n- Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.\nStrategic Stance: We’re threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&D by 30%.\nIn sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI.
