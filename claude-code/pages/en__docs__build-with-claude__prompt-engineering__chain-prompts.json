Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?\nEnter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.\n​\nWhy chain prompts?\nAccuracy\n: Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing errors.\nClarity\n: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.\nTraceability\n: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.\n​\nWhen to chain prompts\nUse prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.\nRemember:\nEach link in the chain gets Claude’s full attention!\nDebugging tip\n: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.\n​\nHow to chain prompts\nIdentify subtasks\n: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.\nStructure with XML for clear handoffs\n: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.\nHave a single-task goal\n: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.\nIterate\n: Refine subtasks based on Claude’s performance.\n​\nExample chained workflows:\nMulti-step analysis\n: See the legal and business examples below.\nContent creation pipelines\n: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.\nData processing\n: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.\nDecision-making\n: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.\nVerification loops\n: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.\nOptimization tip\n: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.\n​\nAdvanced: Self-correction chains\nYou can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.\nExample: Self-correcting research summary\n​\nPrompt 1\nRole\nContent\nUser\nSummarize this medical research paper.\n<paper>{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}</paper>\nFocus on methodology, findings, and clinical implications.\nAssistant\n{{SUMMARY}}\nMethodology: Double-blind RCT with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received novel GLP-1/GIP dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received standard GLP-1 agonist. 24-week trial, primary endpoint: HbA1c reduction.\nFindings:\n- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction\n- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction\n- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%\n- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss\n- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss\nSafety: Similar adverse event profiles, no serious events attributed to treatment.\nClinical Implications: Dual agonist shows superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard therapy. Could be a game-changer, especially for obese diabetics.\n​\nPrompt 2\nRole\nContent\nUser\nYour task is to provide feedback on a research paper summary. Here is a summary of a medical research paper:\n<summary>\n{{SUMMARY}}\n</summary>\nHere is the research paper:\n<paper>\n{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}\n</paper>\nReview this summary for accuracy, clarity, and completeness on a graded A-F scale.\nAssistant\n{{FEEDBACK}}\n1. Accuracy: A\n- Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.\n- Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.\n- Assertion of “game-changer” is justified by significantly better outcomes.\n2. Clarity: A-\n- Concise and well-structured with clear sections.\n- Good use of comparative language (e.g., “up 3% from Q1”) for context.\n- Minor issue: Acronyms like “RCT,” “GLP-1,” and “GIP” not defined. Consider spelling out first use.\n3. Completeness: B+\n- Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.\n- Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).\n- Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).\n- Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.\nOverall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies.\n​\nPrompt 3\nRole\nContent\nUser\nYour task is to improve a paper summary given feedback. Here is the first draft of a medical research paper:\n<summary>\n{{SUMMARY}}\n</summary>\nHere is the research paper:\n<paper>\n{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}\n</paper>\nHere is the feedback:\n<feedback>\n{{FEEDBACK}}\n</feedback>\nUpdate the summary based on the feedback.\nAssistant\nMethodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial’s primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.\nFindings:\n- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction\n- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction\n- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%\n- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss\n- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss\nSecondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.\nSafety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.\nClinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes.\n​\nExamples\nExample: Analyzing a legal contract (without chaining)\nNote that Claude misses the instruction to provide proposed changes in its email draft.\nRole\nContent\nUser\nYou’re our Chief Legal Officer.

Cost-effectiveness:\n+ Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.\n+ Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.\n- Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.\n- No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving.\n​\nPrompt 2\nRole\nContent\nUser\nDraft a strategy review document for engineering leadership based on this analysis of a multitenancy strategy.\n<strategy>\n{{STRATEGY}}\n</strategy>\n<analysis>\n{{ANALYSIS}}\n</analysis>\nInclude an executive summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations.\nAssistant\n{{STRATEGY_DOC}}\n# Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product\n## Executive Summary\nThe proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.\n## Detailed Analysis\n### 1. Scalability: B+\nStrengths:\n- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.\n- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.\nWeaknesses:\n- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.\n- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.\n### 2. Security: B-\nStrengths:\n- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.\n- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.\nWeaknesses:\n- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.\n- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?\n- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).\n### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B\nStrengths:\n- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.\n- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.\nWeaknesses:\n- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.\n- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.\n- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.\n## Recommendations\n1.\nApp Tier Resilience\n: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.\n2.\nSecurity Hardening\n:\na. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).\nb. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.\nc. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.\n3.\nCost Optimization\n:\na. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.\nb. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.\nc. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.\n4.\nProof of Concept (PoC)\n: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:\na. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.\nb. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.\nc. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.\nWith these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients.\n​\nPrompt 3\nRole\nContent\nUser\nGrade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities.\n<priorities>\n{{PRIORITIES}}\n</priorities>\n<strategy_doc>\n{{STRATEGY_DOC}}\n</strategy_doc>\nAssistant\n1. Clarity: A\n+ Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.\n+ Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.\n+ Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.\n+ Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.\n2. Actionability: A-\n+ Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., “Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes”).\n+ PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.\n+ Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.\n+ Consider: Add a “Next Steps” section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.\n3. Enterprise Alignment: A+\n+ Directly addresses enterprise priorities:\n- Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.\n- Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.\n- Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).\n+ PoC with “high-scale simulation” and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.\n+ Language resonates with enterprise concerns: “unacceptable risk,” “enterprise-grade,” “instill confidence.”\nOverall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a “Next Steps” section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership.
