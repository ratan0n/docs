This phenomenon, known as “hallucination,” can undermine the reliability of your AI-driven solutions.\nThis guide will explore techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure Claude’s outputs are accurate and trustworthy.\n​\nBasic hallucination minimization strategies\nAllow Claude to say “I don’t know”:\nExplicitly give Claude permission to admit uncertainty. This simple technique can drastically reduce false information.\nExample: Analyzing a merger & acquisition report\nRole\nContent\nUser\nAs our M&A advisor, analyze this report on the potential acquisition of AcmeCo by ExampleCorp.\n<report>\n{{REPORT}}\n</report>\nFocus on financial projections, integration risks, and regulatory hurdles. If you’re unsure about any aspect or if the report lacks necessary information, say “I don’t have enough information to confidently assess this.”\nUse direct quotes for factual grounding:\nFor tasks involving long documents (>20K tokens), ask Claude to extract word-for-word quotes first before performing its task. This grounds its responses in the actual text, reducing hallucinations.\nExample: Auditing a data privacy policy\nRole\nContent\nUser\nAs our Data Protection Officer, review this updated privacy policy for GDPR and CCPA compliance.\n<policy>\n{{POLICY}}\n</policy>\n1. Extract exact quotes from the policy that are most relevant to GDPR and CCPA compliance. If you can’t find relevant quotes, state “No relevant quotes found.”\n2. Use the quotes to analyze the compliance of these policy sections, referencing the quotes by number. Only base your analysis on the extracted quotes.\nVerify with citations\n: Make Claude’s response auditable by having it cite quotes and sources for each of its claims. You can also have Claude verify each claim by finding a supporting quote after it generates a response. If it can’t find a quote, it must retract the claim.\nExample: Drafting a press release on a product launch\nRole\nContent\nUser\nDraft a press release for our new cybersecurity product, AcmeSecurity Pro, using only information from these product briefs and market reports.\n<documents>\n{{DOCUMENTS}}\n</documents>\nAfter drafting, review each claim in your press release. For each claim, find a direct quote from the documents that supports it. If you can’t find a supporting quote for a claim, remove that claim from the press release and mark where it was removed with empty [] brackets.\n​\nAdvanced techniques\nChain-of-thought verification\n: Ask Claude to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.\nBest-of-N verficiation\n: Run Claude through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.\nIterative refinement\n: Use Claude’s outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.\nExternal knowledge restriction\n: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.\nRemember, while these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, they don’t eliminate them entirely. Always validate critical information, especially for high-stakes decisions.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nReducing latency\nIncrease output consistency\nOn this page\nBasic hallucination minimization strategies\nAdvanced techniques",
