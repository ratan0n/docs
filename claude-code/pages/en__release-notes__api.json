To enable fine-grained tool streaming, use the\nbeta header\nfine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14\n.\n​\nMay 22, 2025\nWe’ve launched\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4\n, our latest models with extended thinking capabilities. Learn more in our\nModels & Pricing documentation\n.\nThe default behavior of\nextended thinking\nin Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude’s full thinking process, with the full thinking encrypted and returned in the\nsignature\nfield of\nthinking\nblock output.\nWe’ve launched\ninterleaved thinking\nin public beta, a feature that enables Claude to think in between tool calls. To enable interleaved thinking, use the\nbeta header\ninterleaved-thinking-2025-05-14\n.\nWe’ve launched the\nFiles API\nin public beta, enabling you to upload files and reference them in the Messages API and code execution tool.\nWe’ve launched the\nCode execution tool\nin public beta, a tool that enables Claude to execute Python code in a secure, sandboxed environment.\nWe’ve launched the\nMCP connector\nin public beta, a feature that allows you to connect to remote MCP servers directly from the Messages API.\nTo increase answer quality and decrease tool errors, we’ve changed the default value for the\ntop_p\nnucleus sampling\nparameter in the Messages API from 0.999 to 0.99 for all models. To revert this change, set\ntop_p\nto 0.999.\nAdditionally, when extended thinking is enabled, you can now set\ntop_p\nto values between 0.95 and 1.\nWe’ve moved our\nGo SDK\nfrom beta to GA.\n​\nMay 21, 2025\nWe’ve moved our\nRuby SDK\nfrom beta to GA.\n​\nMay 7, 2025\nWe’ve launched a web search tool in the API, allowing Claude to access up-to-date information from the web. Learn more in our\nweb search tool documentation\n.\n​\nMay 1, 2025\nCache control must now be specified directly in the parent\ncontent\nblock of\ntool_result\nand\ndocument.source\n. For backwards compatibility, if cache control is detected on the last block in\ntool_result.content\nor\ndocument.source.content\n, it will be automatically applied to the parent block instead. Cache control on any other blocks within\ntool_result.content\nand\ndocument.source.content\nwill result in a validation error.\n​\nApril 9th, 2025\nWe launched a beta version of the\nRuby SDK\n​\nMarch 31st, 2025\nWe’ve moved our\nJava SDK\nfrom beta to GA.\nWe’ve moved our\nGo SDK\nfrom alpha to beta.\n​\nFebruary 27th, 2025\nWe’ve added URL source blocks for images and PDFs in the Messages API. You can now reference images and PDFs directly via URL instead of having to base64-encode them. Learn more in our\nvision documentation\nand\nPDF support documentation\n.\nWe’ve added support for a\nnone\noption to the\ntool_choice\nparameter in the Messages API that prevents Claude from calling any tools. Additionally, you’re no longer required to provide any\ntools\nwhen including\ntool_use\nand\ntool_result\nblocks.\nWe’ve launched an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, allowing you to test Claude models by changing just your API key, base URL, and model name in existing OpenAI integrations. This compatibility layer supports core chat completions functionality. Learn more in our\nOpenAI SDK compatibility documentation\n.\n​\nFebruary 24th, 2025\nWe’ve launched\nClaude Sonnet 3.7\n, our most intelligent model yet. Claude Sonnet 3.7 can produce near-instant responses or show its extended thinking step-by-step. One model, two ways to think. Learn more about all Claude models in our\nModels & Pricing documentation\n.\nWe’ve added vision support to Claude Haiku 3.5, enabling the model to analyze and understand images.\nWe’ve released a token-efficient tool use implementation, improving overall performance when using tools with Claude. Learn more in our\ntool use documentation\n.\nWe’ve changed the default temperature in the\nConsole\nfor new prompts from 0 to 1 for consistency with the default temperature in the API. Existing saved prompts are unchanged.\nWe’ve released updated versions of our tools that decouple the text edit and bash tools from the computer use system prompt:\nbash_20250124\n: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.\ntext_editor_20250124\n: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.\ncomputer_20250124\n: Updated computer use tool with new command options including “hold_key”, “left_mouse_down”, “left_mouse_up”, “scroll”, “triple_click”, and “wait”. This tool requires the “computer-use-2025-01-24” anthropic-beta header.\nLearn more in our\ntool use documentation\n.\n​\nFebruary 10th, 2025\nWe’ve added the\nanthropic-organization-id\nresponse header to all API responses. This header provides the organization ID associated with the API key used in the request.\n​\nJanuary 31st, 2025\nWe’ve moved our\nJava SDK\nfrom alpha to beta.\n​\nJanuary 23rd, 2025\nWe’ve launched citations capability in the API, allowing Claude to provide source attribution for information. Learn more in our\ncitations documentation\n.\nWe’ve added support for plain text documents and custom content documents in the Messages API.\n​\nJanuary 21st, 2025\nWe announced the deprecation of the Claude 2, Claude 2.1, and Claude Sonnet 3 models. Read more in\nour documentation\n.\n​\nJanuary 15th, 2025\nWe’ve updated\nprompt caching\nto be easier to use.

Read more\nhere\n.\n​\nOctober 3rd, 2024\nWe’ve added the ability to disable parallel tool use in the API.
