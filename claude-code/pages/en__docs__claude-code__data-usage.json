We may use feedback to improve our products and services, but we will not train generative models using your feedback from Claude Code.\n​\nDevelopment Partner Program\nIf you explicitly opt in to methods to provide us with materials to train on, such as via the\nDevelopment Partner Program\n, we may use those materials provided to train our models. An organization admin can expressly opt-in to the Development Partner Program for their organization. Note that this program is available only for Anthropic first-party API, and not for Bedrock or Vertex users.\n​\nFeedback transcripts\nIf you choose to send us feedback about Claude Code, such as transcripts of your usage, Anthropic may use that feedback to debug related issues and improve Claude Code’s functionality (e.g., to reduce the risk of similar bugs occurring in the future). We will not train generative models using this feedback. Given their potentially sensitive nature, we store user feedback transcripts for only 30 days.\n​\nData retention\nYou can use an API key from a zero data retention organization. When doing so, Claude Code will not retain your chat transcripts on our servers. Users’ local Claude Code clients may store sessions locally for up to 30 days so that users can resume them. This behavior is configurable.\n​\nPrivacy safeguards\nWe have implemented several safeguards to protect your data, including:\nLimited retention periods for sensitive information\nRestricted access to user session data\nClear policies against using feedback for model training\nFor full details, please review our\nCommercial Terms of Service\nand\nPrivacy Policy\n.\n​\nData flow and dependencies\nClaude Code is installed from\nNPM\n. Claude Code runs locally. In order to interact with the LLM, Claude Code sends data over the network. This data includes all user prompts and model outputs. The data is encrypted in transit via TLS and is not encrypted at rest. Claude Code is compatible with most popular VPNs and LLM proxies.\nClaude Code is built on Anthropic’s APIs. For details regarding our API’s security controls, including our API logging procedures, please refer to compliance artifacts offered in the\nAnthropic Trust Center\n.\n​\nTelemetry services\nClaude Code connects from users’ machines to the Statsig service to log operational metrics such as latency, reliability, and usage patterns. This logging does not include any code or file paths. Data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using 256-bit AES encryption. Read more in the\nStatsig security documentation\n. To opt out of Statsig telemetry, set the\nDISABLE_TELEMETRY\nenvironment variable.\nClaude Code connects from users’ machines to Sentry for operational error logging. The data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using 256-bit AES encryption. Read more in the\nSentry security documentation\n. To opt out of error logging, set the\nDISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING\nenvironment variable.\nWhen users run the\n/bug\ncommand, a copy of their full conversation history including code is sent to Anthropic. The data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Optionally, a Github issue is created in our public repository. To opt out of bug reporting, set the\nDISABLE_BUG_COMMAND\nenvironment variable.\n​\nDefault behaviors by API provider\nBy default, we disable all non-essential traffic (including error reporting, telemetry, and bug reporting functionality) when using Bedrock or Vertex. You can also opt out of all of these at once by setting the\nCLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC\nenvironment variable. Here are the full default behaviors:\nService\nAnthropic API\nVertex API\nBedrock API\nStatsig (Metrics)\nDefault on.\nDISABLE_TELEMETRY=1\nto disable.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX\nmust be 1.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK\nmust be 1.\nSentry (Errors)\nDefault on.\nDISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=1\nto disable.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX\nmust be 1.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK\nmust be 1.\nAnthropic API (\n/bug\nreports)\nDefault on.\nDISABLE_BUG_COMMAND=1\nto disable.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX\nmust be 1.\nDefault off.\nCLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK\nmust be 1.\nAll environment variables can be checked into\nsettings.json\n(\nread more\n).\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nSettings\nLegal and compliance\nOn this page\nData policies\nData training policy\nDevelopment Partner Program\nFeedback transcripts\nData retention\nPrivacy safeguards\nData flow and dependencies\nTelemetry services\nDefault behaviors by API provider",
