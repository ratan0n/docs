The average cost is $6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below $12 for 90% of users.\nFor team usage, Claude Code charges by API token consumption. On average, Claude Code costs ~$50-60/developer per month with Sonnet 4 though there is large variance depending on how many instances users are running and whether they’re using it in automation.\n​\nTrack your costs\nUse\n/cost\nto see current session usage\nAnthropic Console users\n:\nCheck\nhistorical usage\nin the Anthropic Console (requires Admin or Billing role)\nSet\nworkspace spend limits\nfor the Claude Code workspace (requires Admin role)\nPro and Max plan users\n: Usage is included in your subscription\n​\nManaging costs for teams\nWhen using Anthropic API, you can limit the total Claude Code workspace spend. To configure,\nfollow these instructions\n. Admins can view cost and usage reporting by\nfollowing these instructions\n.\nOn Bedrock and Vertex, Claude Code does not send metrics from your cloud. In order to get cost metrics, several large enterprises reported using\nLiteLLM\n, which is an open-source tool that helps companies\ntrack spend by key\n. This project is unaffiliated with Anthropic and we have not audited its security.\n​\nReduce token usage\nCompact conversations:\nClaude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity\nToggle auto-compact: Run\n/config\nand navigate to “Auto-compact enabled”\nUse\n/compact\nmanually when context gets large\nAdd custom instructions:\n/compact Focus on code samples and API usage\nCustomize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:\n#\nSummary instructions\nWhen you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes\nWrite specific queries:\nAvoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning\nBreak down complex tasks:\nSplit large tasks into focused interactions\nClear history between tasks:\nUse\n/clear\nto reset context\nCosts can vary significantly based on:\nSize of codebase being analyzed\nComplexity of queries\nNumber of files being searched or modified\nLength of conversation history\nFrequency of compacting conversations\nBackground processes (haiku generation, conversation summarization)\n​\nBackground token usage\nClaude Code uses tokens for some background functionality even when idle:\nHaiku generation\n: Small creative messages that appear while you type (approximately 1 cent per day)\nConversation summarization\n: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the\nclaude --resume\nfeature\nCommand processing\n: Some commands like\n/cost\nmay generate requests to check status\nThese background processes consume a small amount of tokens (typically under $0.04 per session) even without active interaction.\nFor team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to\nestablish usage patterns before wider rollout.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nMonitoring\nCLI reference\nOn this page\nTrack your costs\nManaging costs for teams\nReduce token usage\nBackground token usage",
