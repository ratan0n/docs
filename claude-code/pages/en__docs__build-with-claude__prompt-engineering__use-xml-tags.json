They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.\nXML tip\n: Use tags like\n<instructions>\n,\n<example>\n, and\n<formatting>\nto clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.\n​\nWhy use XML tags?\nClarity:\nClearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.\nAccuracy:\nReduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.\nFlexibility:\nEasily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.\nParseability:\nHaving Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.\nThere are no canonical “best” XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.\n​\nTagging best practices\nBe consistent\n: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g,\nUsing the contract in <contract> tags...\n).\nNest tags\n: You should nest tags\n<outer><inner></inner></outer>\nfor hierarchical content.\nPower user tip\n: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (\n<examples>\n) or chain of thought (\n<thinking>\n,\n<answer>\n). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.\n​\nExamples\nExample: Generating financial reports\nWithout XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn’t match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.\nRole\nNo XML Tags\nWith XML Tags\nUser\nYou’re a financial analyst at AcmeCorp.

Revenue Growth:\nOur Q2 revenue reached $15.2M, a 22% YoY increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 30% expansion in our enterprise client base. However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3.\n2. Profit Margins:\nGross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R&D for our upcoming AI-driven features.\n3. Cash Flow:\nOperating cash flow remains strong at $4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at $28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we’re addressing through more efficient sales strategies.\nIn summary, AcmeCorp’s core financials remain robust. We’re balancing growth investments with prudent cash management. Our focus for Q3 will be revitalizing SMB growth and optimizing sales efficiency.\nThank you for your continued trust.\nSincerely,\nCFO, AcmeCorp\nQ2 Financial Report for AcmeCorp Investors</output>\nRevenue Growth:\n- Q2 revenue: $15.2M (22% YoY ↑)\n- Enterprise clients: 30% ↑\n- SMB segment: 5% ↓\nAction: Targeted Q3 marketing\nProfit Margins:\n- Gross margin: 72% (3% ↑ from Q1)\nReason: Infrastructure optimizations\n- EBITDA margin: 18% (2% ↓)\nReason: R&D investment in AI features\nCash Flow:\n- Operating cash flow: $4.1M (strong)\n- Cash reserves: $28M (15-month runway)\n- Customer acquisition cost: 20% ↑\nAction: Optimize sales strategies\nOutlook:\n- Core financials: Robust\n- Q3 focus: Revitalize SMB, optimize sales\nManagement remains committed to balancing growth investments with financial discipline.\nExample: Legal contract analysis\nWithout XML tags, Claude’s analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on.\nRole\nNo XML Tags\nWith XML Tags\nUser\nAnalyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks and liabilities: {{CONTRACT}}. Focus on indemnification, limitation of liability, and IP ownership clauses. Also, note any unusual or concerning terms. Here’s our standard contract for reference: {{STANDARD_CONTRACT}}. Give a summary of findings and recommendations for our legal team.\nAnalyze this software licensing agreement for legal risks and liabilities.\nWe’re a multinational enterprise considering this agreement for our core data infrastructure.\n<agreement>\n{{CONTRACT}}</agreement>\nThis is our standard contract for reference:\n<standard_contract>{{STANDARD_CONTRACT}}</standard_contract>\n<instructions>\n1. Analyze these clauses:\n- Indemnification\n- Limitation of liability\n- IP ownership\n2. Note unusual or concerning terms.\n3. Compare to our standard contract.\n4. Summarize findings in <findings> tags.\n5. List actionable recommendations in <recommendations> tags.</instructions>\nAssistant\nThe provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.\nIn summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors.\n<findings>\n1. Indemnification (Clause 8):\n- Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.\n- Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor’s negligence or product defects.\n- Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.\n2. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9):\n- Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages.\n- Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions.\n- Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.\n3. IP Ownership (Clause 12):\n- Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations.\n- Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights.\n- Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.\n4. Unusual Terms:\n- Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for “any purpose.”\n- Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for “convenience” with only 7 days’ notice.\n- Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.\n</findings>\n<recommendations>\n1. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.\n2. Counter-propose:\n- Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement.\n- Liability: Cap at 12 months’ fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect.\n- IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations.\n- Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only.\n- Termination: Minimum 90 days’ notice; only for cause.\n- Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.\n3. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions.\n4. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes.\n</recommendations>\nPrompt library\nGet inspired by a curated selection of prompts for various tasks and use cases.\nGitHub prompting tutorial\nAn example-filled tutorial that covers the prompt engineering concepts found in our docs.\nGoogle Sheets prompting tutorial\nA lighter weight version of our prompt engineering tutorial via an interactive spreadsheet.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nLet Claude think (CoT)\nGive Claude a role (system prompts)\nOn this page\nWhy use XML tags?\nTagging best practices\nExamples",
