Navigation Administration Monitoring Welcome Developer Guide API Guide Claude Code Model Context Protocol (MCP) Resources Release Notes Documentation Developer Discord Support Getting started Overview Set up Quickstart Memory management Common workflows Build with Claude Add Claude Code to your IDE Model Context Protocol (MCP) GitHub Actions Claude Code SDK Troubleshooting Deployment Overview Amazon Bedrock Google Vertex AI Corporate proxy LLM gateway Development containers Administration Identity and Access Management Security Monitoring Costs Reference CLI reference Interactive mode Slash commands Settings Resources Data usage Legal and compliance Claude Code supports OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics and events for monitoring and observability. All metrics are time series data exported via OpenTelemetrys standard metrics protocol, and events are exported via OpenTelemetrys logs/events protocol. It is the users responsibility to ensure their metrics and logs backends are properly configured and that the aggregation granularity meets their monitoring requirements. OpenTelemetry support is currently in beta and details are subject to change.  Quick Start Configure OpenTelemetry using environment variables: export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY = 1 export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER = otlp export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER = otlp export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL = grpc export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = http://localhost:4317 export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = \"Authorization=Bearer your-token\" export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL = 10000 export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL = 5000 claude The default export intervals are 60 seconds for metrics and 5 seconds for logs. During setup, you may want to use shorter intervals for debugging purposes. Remember to reset these for production use. For full configuration options, see the OpenTelemetry specification .  Administrator Configuration Administrators can configure OpenTelemetry settings for all users through the managed settings file. This allows for centralized control of telemetry settings across an organization. See the settings precedence for more information about how settings are applied. The managed settings file is located at: macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json Linux: /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json Example managed settings configuration: { \"env\" : { \"CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY\" : \"1\" , \"OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER\" : \"otlp\" , \"OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER\" : \"otlp\" , \"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL\" : \"grpc\" , \"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\" : \"http://collector.company.com:4317\" , \"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS\" : \"Authorization=Bearer company-token\" } } Managed settings can be distributed via MDM (Mobile Device Management) or other device management solutions. Environment variables defined in the managed settings file have high precedence and cannot be overridden by users.
