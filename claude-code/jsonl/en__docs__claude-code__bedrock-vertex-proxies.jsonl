Using Bedrock with corporate proxy Route Bedrock traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy: export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK = 1 export AWS_REGION = us-east-1 export HTTPS_PROXY = 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'  Using Bedrock with LLM Gateway Use a gateway service that provides Bedrock-compatible endpoints: export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK = 1 export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL = 'https://your-llm-gateway.com/bedrock' export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH = 1  Using Vertex AI with corporate proxy Route Vertex AI traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy: export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX = 1 export CLOUD_ML_REGION = us-east5 export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID = your-project-id export HTTPS_PROXY = 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'  Using Vertex AI with LLM Gateway Combine Google Vertex AI models with an LLM gateway for centralized management: export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX = 1 export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL = 'https://your-llm-gateway.com/vertex' export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH = 1  Authentication configuration Claude Code uses the ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN for both Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers when needed. The SKIP_AUTH flags ( CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH , CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH ) are used in LLM gateway scenarios where the gateway handles provider authentication.  Choosing the right deployment configuration Consider these factors when selecting your deployment approach:  Direct provider access Best for organizations that: Want the simplest setup Have existing AWS or GCP infrastructure Need provider-native monitoring and compliance  Corporate proxy Best for organizations that: Have existing corporate proxy requirements Need traffic monitoring and compliance Must"}]}
