This integration allows you to leverage Claudes capabilities directly within your preferred development environment.  Supported IDEs Claude Code currently supports two major IDE families: Visual Studio Code (including popular forks like Cursor and Windsurf) JetBrains IDEs (including PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, and GoLand)  Features Quick launch : Use Cmd+Esc (Mac) or Ctrl+Esc (Windows/Linux) to open Claude Code directly from your editor, or click the Claude Code button in the UI Diff viewing : Code changes can be displayed directly in the IDE diff viewer instead of the terminal. You can configure this in /config Selection context : The current selection/tab in the IDE is automatically shared with Claude Code File reference shortcuts : Use Cmd+Option+K (Mac) or Alt+Ctrl+K (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (e.g., @File#L1-99) Diagnostic sharing : Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE are automatically shared with Claude as you work  Installation  VS Code Open VSCode Open the integrated terminal Run claude - the extension will auto-install Going forward you can also use the /ide command in any external terminal to connect to the IDE. These installation instructions also apply to VS Code forks like Cursor and Windsurf.  JetBrains IDEs Install the Claude Code plugin from the marketplace and restart your IDE. The plugin may also be auto-installed when you run claude in the integrated terminal. The IDE must be restarted completely to take effect. Remote Development Limitations : When using JetBrains Remote Development, you must install the plugin in the remote host via Settings > Plugin (Host) .  Configuration Both integrations work with Claude Codes configuration system. To enable IDE-specific features: Connect Claude Code to your IDE by running claude in the built-in terminal Run the /config command Set the diff tool to auto for automatic IDE detection Claude Code will automatically use the appropriate viewer based on your IDE If youre using an external terminal (not the IDEs built-in terminal), you can still connect to your IDE by using the /ide command after launching Claude Code. This allows you to benefit from IDE integration features even when running Claude from a separate terminal application. This works for both VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. When using an external terminal, to ensure Claude has default access to the same files as your IDE, start Claude from the same directory as your IDE project root.  Troubleshooting  VS Code extension not installing Ensure youre running Claude Code from VS Codes integrated terminal Ensure that the CLI corresponding to your IDE is installed: For VS Code: code command should be available For Cursor: cursor command should be available For Windsurf: windsurf command should be available If not installed, use Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) and search for Shell Command: Install code command in PATH (or the equivalent for your IDE) Check that VS Code has permission to install extensions  JetBrains plugin not working Ensure youre running Claude Code from the project root directory Check that the JetBrains plugin is enabled in"}]}
