Claude Code
​
June 11, 2025
We’ve launched
fine-grained tool streaming
in public beta, a feature that enables Claude to stream tool use parameters without buffering / JSON validation. To enable fine-grained tool streaming, use the
beta header
fine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14
.
​
May 22, 2025
We’ve launched
Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4
, our latest models with extended thinking capabilities. Learn more in our
Models & Pricing documentation
.
The default behavior of
extended thinking
in Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude’s full thinking process, with the full thinking encrypted and returned in the
signature
field of
thinking
block output.
We’ve launched
interleaved thinking
in public beta, a feature that enables Claude to think in between tool calls. To enable interleaved thinking, use the
beta header
interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14
.
We’ve launched the
Files API
in public beta, enabling you to upload files and reference them in the Messages API and code execution tool.
We’ve launched the
Code execution tool
in public beta, a tool that enables Claude to execute Python code in a secure, sandboxed environment.
We’ve launched the
MCP connector
in public beta, a feature that allows you to connect to remote MCP servers directly from the Messages API.
To increase answer quality and decrease tool errors, we’ve changed the default value for the
top_p
nucleus sampling
parameter in the Messages API from 0.999 to 0.99 for all models. To revert this change, set
top_p
to 0.999.
Additionally, when extended thinking is enabled, you can now set
top_p
to values between 0.95 and 1.
We’ve moved our
Go SDK
from beta to GA.
​
May 21, 2025
We’ve moved our
Ruby SDK
from beta to GA.
​
May 7, 2025
We’ve launched a web search tool in the API, allowing Claude to access up-to-date information from the web. Learn more in our
web search tool documentation
.
​
May 1, 2025
Cache control must now be specified directly in the parent
content
block of
tool_result
and
document.source
. For backwards compatibility, if cache control is detected on the last block in
tool_result.content
or
document.source.content
, it will be automatically applied to the parent block instead. Cache control on any other blocks within
tool_result.content
and
document.source.content
will result in a validation error.
​
April 9th, 2025
We launched a beta version of the
Ruby SDK
​
March 31st, 2025
We’ve moved our
Java SDK
from beta to GA.
We’ve moved our
Go SDK
from alpha to beta.
​
February 27th, 2025
We’ve added URL source blocks for images and PDFs in the Messages API. You can now reference images and PDFs directly via URL instead of having to base64-encode them. Learn more in our
vision documentation
and
PDF support documentation
.
We’ve added support for a
none
option to the
tool_choice
parameter in the Messages API that prevents Claude from calling any tools. Additionally, you’re no longer required to provide any
tools
when including
tool_use
and
tool_result
blocks.
We’ve launched an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, allowing you to test Claude models by changing just your API key, base URL, and model name in existing OpenAI integrations. This compatibility layer supports core chat completions functionality. Learn more in our
OpenAI SDK compatibility documentation
.
​
February 24th, 2025
We’ve launched
Claude Sonnet 3.7
, our most intelligent model yet. Claude Sonnet 3.7 can produce near-instant responses or show its extended thinking step-by-step. One model, two ways to think. Learn more about all Claude models in our
Models & Pricing documentation
.
We’ve added vision support to Claude Haiku 3.5, enabling the model to analyze and understand images.
We’ve released a token-efficient tool use implementation, improving overall performance when using tools with Claude. Learn more in our
tool use documentation
.
We’ve changed the default temperature in the
Console
for new prompts from 0 to 1 for consistency with the default temperature in the API. Existing saved prompts are unchanged.
We’ve released updated versions of our tools that decouple the text edit and bash tools from the computer use system prompt:
bash_20250124
: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
text_editor_20250124
: Same functionality as previous version but is independent from computer use. Does not require a beta header.
computer_20250124
: Updated computer use tool with new command options including “hold_key”, “left_mouse_down”, “left_mouse_up”, “scroll”, “triple_click”, and “wait”. This tool requires the “computer-use-2025-01-24” anthropic-beta header.
Learn more in our
tool use documentation
.
​
February 10th, 2025
We’ve added the
anthropic-organization-id
response header to all API responses. This header provides the organization ID associated with the API key used in the request.
