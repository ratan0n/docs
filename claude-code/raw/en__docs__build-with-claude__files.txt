Anthropic Privacy Policy
Security and compliance
The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Anthropic API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the
code execution tool
to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls.
The Files API is currently in beta. Please reach out through our
feedback form
to share your experience with the Files API.
​
Supported models
Referencing a
file_id
in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. For example,
images
are supported in all Claude 3+ models,
PDFs
in all Claude 3.5+ models, and
various other file types
for the code execution tool in Claude 3.5 Haiku plus all Claude 3.7+ models.
The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.
​
How the Files API works
The Files API provides a simple create-once, use-many-times approach for working with files:
Upload files
to our secure storage and receive a unique
file_id
Download files
that are created from the code execution tool
Reference files
in
Messages
requests using the
file_id
instead of re-uploading content
Manage your files
with list, retrieve, and delete operations
​
How to use the Files API
To use the Files API, you’ll need to include the beta feature header:
anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14
.
​
Uploading a file
Upload a file to be referenced in future API calls:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
curl
-X
POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files
\
-H
"x-api-key:
$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
"
\
-H
"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01"
\
-H
"anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
\
-F
"file=@/path/to/document.pdf"
​
Using a file in messages
Once uploaded, reference the file using its
file_id
:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
curl
-X
POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
\
-H
"x-api-key:
$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
"
\
-H
"anthropic-version: 2023-06-01"
\
-H
"anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
\
-H
"content-type: application/json"

File storage and limits
​
Storage limits
Maximum file size:
500 MB per file

​
File lifecycle
Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key. Other API keys can use files created by any other API key associated with the same workspace
Files persist until you delete them
Deleted files cannot be recovered

Messages
API calls and associated tool uses
​
Error handling

The file type doesn’t match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
Exceeds context window size (400):
The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a
/v1/messages
request)
Invalid filename (400):
Filename doesn’t meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (
