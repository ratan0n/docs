Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.
​
Model aliases
For convenience during development and testing, we offer aliases for our model ids. These aliases automatically point to the most recent snapshot of a given model. When we release new model snapshots, we migrate aliases to point to the newest version of a model, typically within a week of the new release.
While aliases are useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions (e.g.,
claude-sonnet-4-20250514
) in production applications to ensure consistent behavior.

1 - While trained on publicly available information on the internet through November 2024, Claude Sonnet 3.7’s knowledge cut-off date is the end of October 2024. This means the models’ knowledge base is most extensive and reliable on information and events up to October 2024.
Include the beta header
output-128k-2025-02-19
in your API request to increase the maximum output token length to 128k tokens for Claude Sonnet 3.7.
We strongly suggest using our
streaming Messages API
to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs.
See our guidance on
long requests
for more details.

Prompt and output performance
Claude 4 models excel in:
Performance
: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the
Claude 4 blog post
for more information.
Engaging responses
: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our
prompt engineering guides
for details.
For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our
Claude 4 best practices guide
.
Output quality
: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.
​
Migrating to Claude 4
In most cases, you can switch from Claude 3.7 models to Claude 4 models with minimal changes:
Update your model name:
From:
claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
To:
claude-sonnet-4-20250514
or
claude-opus-4-20250514
Your existing API calls will continue to work without modification, although API behavior has changed slightly in Claude 4 models (see
API release notes
for details).
