Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see

.
Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we’ve created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.
The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the “blank page problem” to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.
Try the prompt generator now directly on the
Console
.
If you’re interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our
prompt generator Google Colab notebook
. There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.
Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an
API key
.
