​
Tool use pricing
Tool use requests are priced based on:
The total number of input tokens sent to the model (including in the
tools
parameter)
The number of output tokens generated
For server-side tools, additional usage-based pricing (e.g., web search charges per search performed)
Client-side tools are priced the same as any other Claude API request, while server-side tools may incur additional charges based on their specific usage.
The additional tokens from tool use come from:
The
tools
parameter in API requests (tool names, descriptions, and schemas)
tool_use
content blocks in API requests and responses
tool_result
content blocks in API requests
When you use
tools
, we also automatically include a special system prompt for the model which enables tool use. The number of tool use tokens required for each model are listed below (excluding the additional tokens listed above). Note that the table assumes at least 1 tool is provided. If no
tools
are provided, then a tool choice of
none
uses 0 additional system prompt tokens.

These token counts are added to your normal input and output tokens to calculate the total cost of a request.
For current per-model prices, refer to our
model pricing
section above.
For more information about tool use implementation and best practices, see our
tool use documentation
.
​
Specific tool pricing
​
Bash tool
The bash tool adds
245 input tokens
to your API calls.
Additional tokens are consumed by:
Command outputs (stdout/stderr)
Error messages
Large file contents
See
tool use pricing
for complete pricing details.
​
Code execution tool
The code execution tool usage is tracked separately from token usage. Execution time is a minimum of 5 minutes.
If files are included in the request, execution time is billed even if the tool is not used due to files being preloaded onto the container.
Pricing
: $0.05 per session-hour.
​
Text editor tool
The text editor tool uses the same pricing structure as other tools used with Claude. It follows the standard input and output token pricing based on the Claude model you’re using.
In addition to the base tokens, the following additional input tokens are needed for the text editor tool:
Tool
Additional input tokens
text_editor_20250429
(Claude 4)
700 tokens
text_editor_20250124
(Claude Sonnet 3.7)
700 tokens
text_editor_20241022
(Claude Sonnet 3.5)
700 tokens
See
tool use pricing
for complete pricing details.
​
Web search tool
Web search usage is charged in addition to token usage:
"usage"
:
{
"input_tokens"
:
105
,
"output_tokens"
:
6039
,
"cache_read_input_tokens"
:
7123
,
"cache_creation_input_tokens"
:
7345
,
"server_tool_use"
:
{
"web_search_requests"
:
1
}
}
Web search is available on the Anthropic API for
$10 per 1,000 searches
, plus standard token costs for search-generated content. Web search results retrieved throughout a conversation are counted as input tokens, in search iterations executed during a single turn and in subsequent conversation turns.
Each web search counts as one use, regardless of the number of results returned. If an error occurs during web search, the web search will not be billed.
​
Computer use tool
Computer use follows the standard
tool use pricing
. When using the computer use tool:
System prompt overhead
: The computer use beta adds 466-499 tokens to the system prompt
Computer use tool token usage
:

Claude 4 / Sonnet 3.7

If you’re also using bash or text editor tools alongside computer use, those tools have their own token costs as documented in their respective pages.
​
Agent use case pricing examples
Understanding pricing for agent applications is crucial when building with Claude. These real-world examples can help you estimate costs for different agent patterns.
​
Customer support agent example
When building a customer support agent, here’s how costs might break down:
Example calculation for processing 10,000 support tickets:

For a detailed walkthrough of this calculation, see our

​
General agent workflow pricing
For more complex agent architectures with multiple steps:
Initial request processing
Typical input: 500-1,000 tokens
Processing cost: ~$0.003 per request
Memory and context retrieval
Retrieved context: 2,000-5,000 tokens
Cost per retrieval: ~$0.015 per operation
Action planning and execution
Planning tokens: 1,000-2,000
Execution feedback: 500-1,000
Combined cost: ~$0.045 per action
For a comprehensive guide on agent pricing patterns, see our
agent use cases guide
.
​
Cost optimization strategies
When building agents with Claude:
Use appropriate models
: Choose Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex reasoning
Implement prompt caching
: Reduce costs for repeated context
Batch operations
: Use the Batch API for non-time-sensitive tasks
Monitor usage patterns
: Track token consumption to identify optimization opportunities
For high-volume agent applications, consider contacting our
enterprise sales team
for custom pricing arrangements.
​

Frequently asked questions
How is token usage calculated?
Tokens are pieces of text that models process. As a rough estimate, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. The exact count varies by language and content type.
Are there free tiers or trials?
New users receive a small amount of free credits to test the API.
Contact sales
for information about extended trials for enterprise evaluation.
How do discounts stack?
Batch API and prompt caching discounts can be combined. For example, using both features together provides significant cost savings compared to standard API calls.
What payment methods are accepted?
We accept major credit cards for standard accounts. Enterprise customers can arrange invoicing and other payment methods.
