What is HTML? HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages HTML describes the structure of a Web page HTML consists of a series of elements HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content HTML elements label pieces of content such as \"this is a heading\", \"this is a paragraph\", \"this is a link\", etc. A Simple HTML Document Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Page Title</title> </head> <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Example Explained The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab) The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. The <h1> element defines a large heading The <p> element defines a paragraph What is an HTML Element? An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag: < tagname > Content goes here... < /tagname > The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: < h1 > My First Heading < /h1 > < p > My first paragraph. < /p > Start tag Element content End tag <h1> My First Heading </h1> <p> My first paragraph. </p> <br> none none Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! Web Browsers The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document: HTML Page Structure Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure: <html> <head> <title>Page title</title> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is another paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible. Semantic HTML Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the <button> element (and not a <div> element). Semantic <button>Report an Error</button> Try it Yourself  Non-semantic <div>Report an Error</div> Try it Yourself  Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud. With the button example in mind: buttons have more suitable styling by default a screen reader identifies it as a button focusable clickable A button is also accessible for people relying on keyboard-only navigation; it can be clickable with both mouse and keys, and it can be tabbed between (using the tab key on the keyboard). Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content. Headings Are Important Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags: Example <h1>Heading 1</h1> <h2>Heading 2</h2> <h3>Heading 3</h3> <h4>Heading 4</h4> <h5>Heading 5</h5> <h6>Heading 6</h6> Try it Yourself  Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections. Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3> , and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold . Alternative Text The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). The value of the alt attribute should describe the image: Example <img src=\"img_chania.jpg\" alt=\"A narrow city street with flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute: Example <img src=\"wrongname.gif\" alt=\"A narrow city street with flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  Declare the Language You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. The following example specifies English as the language: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> ... </body> </html> Use Clear Language Always use a clear language, that is easy to understand. Also try to avoid characters that cannot be read clearly by a screen reader. For example: Keep sentences as short as possible Avoid dashes. Instead of writing 1-3, write 1 to 3 Avoid abbreviations. Instead of writing Feb, write February Avoid slang words Create Good Link Text A link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link. Examples of good and bad links: Good Find out more about the HTML language Read more about how to eat healthy Buy tickets to Mars here Try it Yourself  Bad Click here Read more.. Buy tickets to Mars here Try it Yourself  Note: This page is an introduction in web accessibility. Visit our Accessibility Tutorial for more details.

HTML Elements The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: < tagname > Content goes here... < /tagname > Examples of some HTML elements: < h1 > My First Heading < /h1 > < p > My first paragraph. < /p > Start tag Element content End tag <h1> My First Heading </h1> <p> My first paragraph. </p> <br> none none Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! Nested HTML Elements HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements). All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements. The following example contains four HTML elements ( <html> , <body> , <h1> and <p> ): Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Example Explained The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document. It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html> . Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element: <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> The <body> element defines the document's body. It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body> . Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p> : <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> The <h1> element defines a heading. It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1> : <h1>My First Heading</h1> The <p> element defines a paragraph. It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p> : <p>My first paragraph.</p> Never Skip the End Tag Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag: Example <html> <body> <p>This is a paragraph <p>This is a paragraph </body> </html> Try it Yourself  However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag! Empty HTML Elements HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag: Example <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML is Not Case Sensitive HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p> . The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML. At W3Schools we always use lowercase tag names. HTML Tag Reference W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

The HTML charset Attribute The character set is specified in the <meta> tag: Example <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world! Full UTF-8 Reference The ASCII Character Set ASCII was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: English letters (A-Z) Numbers (0-9) Special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < >. The ANSI Character Set ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set: Identical to ASCII for the first 127 characters Special characters from 128 to 159 Identical to UTF-8 from 160 to 255 <meta charset=\"Windows-1252\"> The ISO-8859-1 Character Set ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8. Identical to ASCII for the first 127 characters Does not use the characters from 128 to 159 Identical to ANSI and UTF-8 from 160 to 255 HTML 4 Example <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\"> HTML 5 Example <meta charset=\"ISO-8859-1\"> The UTF-8 Character Set is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127 Does not use the characters from 128 to 159 Identical to ANSI and 8859-1 from 160 to 255 Continues from the value 256 to 10 000 characters <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> Full HTML Character Set Reference .

Locate the User's Position The Geolocation API is used to access the user's current location. Since this can compromise privacy, the location is not available unless the user approves it. Try It Note: The Geolocation API is only available on secure contexts such as HTTPS. Tip: The Geolocation API is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones or smartwatches. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Geolocation. API Geolocation 5.0 12.0 3.5 5.0 10.6 Using HTML Geolocation API The Geolocation API is accessed via a call to navigator.geolocation . This will cause the browser to ask the user for permission to access their location data. If the user accept, the browser will search for the best available functionality on the device to access this information (for example GPS). The getCurrentPosition() method is used to return the user's current location. The example below returns the latitude and longitude of the user's current location: Example <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"demo\"); function getLocation() { if (navigator.geolocation) { navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error); } else { x.innerHTML = \"Geolocation is not supported by this browser.\"; } } function success(position) { x.innerHTML = \"Latitude: \" + position.coords.latitude + \"<br>Longitude: \" + position.coords.longitude; } function error() { alert(\"Sorry, no position available.\"); } </script> Try it Yourself  Example explained: Check if Geolocation is supported If Geolocation is supported, run the getCurrentPosition() method. If not, display a message to the user The success() function outputs the user's location in latitude and longitude The error() function alerts a text if the browser retrieves an error in getCurrentPosition() Error Handling and Rejections The second parameter of the getCurrentPosition() method is used to handle errors. It specifies a function to run if it fails to get the user's location. Here is an example of a more specific error handling: Example function error(error) { switch(error.code) { case error.PERMISSION_DENIED: x.innerHTML = \"User denied the request for Geolocation.\" break; case error.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE: x.innerHTML = \"Location information is unavailable.\" break; case error.TIMEOUT: x.innerHTML = \"The request to get user location timed out.\" break; case error.UNKNOWN_ERROR: x.innerHTML = \"An unknown error occurred.\" break; } } Try it Yourself  Location-specific Information Geolocation is also very useful for location-specific information, like: Up-to-date local information Showing Points-of-interest near the user Turn-by-turn navigation (GPS) The getCurrentPosition() Method - Return Data The getCurrentPosition() method returns an object on success. The latitude, longitude and accuracy properties are always returned. The other properties are returned if available: Property Returns coords.latitude The latitude as a decimal number (always returned) coords.longitude The longitude as a decimal number (always returned) coords.accuracy The accuracy of position (always returned) coords.altitude The altitude in meters above the mean sea level (returned if available) coords.altitudeAccuracy The altitude accuracy of position (returned if available) coords.heading The heading as degrees clockwise from North (returned if available) coords.speed The speed in meters per second (returned if available) timestamp The date/time of the response (returned if available) Geolocation Object - Other interesting Methods The Geolocation object also has other interesting methods: watchPosition() - Returns the current location of the user and continues to return updated location as the user moves (like the GPS in a car). clearWatch() - Stops the watchPosition() method. The example below shows the watchPosition() method. You need an accurate GPS device to test this (like a smartphone): Example <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"demo\"); function getLocation() { if (navigator.geolocation) { navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(success, error); } else { x.innerHTML = \"Geolocation is not supported by this browser.\"; } } function success(position) { x.innerHTML = \"Latitude: \" + position.coords.latitude + \"<br>Longitude: \" + position.coords.longitude; } function error(error) { switch(error.code) { case error.PERMISSION_DENIED: x.innerHTML = \"User denied the request for Geolocation.\" break; case error.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE: x.innerHTML = \"Location information is unavailable.\" break; case error.TIMEOUT: x.innerHTML = \"The request to get user location timed out.\" break; case error.UNKNOWN_ERROR: x.innerHTML = \"An unknown error occurred.\" break; } } </script> Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Example Drag the W3Schools image into the second rectangle. Drag and Drop Drag and drop is a very common feature. It is when you \"grab\" an object and drag it to a different location. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Drag and Drop. API Drag and Drop 4.0 9.0 3.5 6.0 12.0 HTML Drag and Drop API Example The example below is a simple drag and drop example: Example <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head> <script> function dragstartHandler(ev) { ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"text\", ev.target.id); } function dragoverHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); } function dropHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); const data = ev.dataTransfer.getData(\"text\"); ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data)); } </script> </head> <body> <div id=\"div1\" ondrop=\"dropHandler(event)\" ondragover=\"dragoverHandler(event)\"></div> <img id=\"img1\" src=\"img_logo.gif\" draggable=\"true\" ondragstart=\"dragstartHandler(event)\" width=\"336\" height=\"69\"> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  It might seem complicated, but lets go through all the different parts of a drag and drop event. Make an Element Draggable First of all: To make an element draggable, set the draggable attribute to true: <img id=\"img1\" draggable=\"true\"> or: <p id=\"p1\" draggable=\"true\">Draggable text</p> What to Drag - ondragstart and setData() Then, specify what should happen when the element is dragged. In the example above, the ondragstart attribute of the <img> element calls a function (dragstartHandler(ev)), that specifies what data to be dragged. The dataTransfer.setData() method sets the data type and the value of the dragged data: function dragstartHandler(ev) { ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"text\", ev.target.id); } In this case, the data type is \"text\" and the value is the id of the draggable element (\"img1\"). Where to Drop - ondragover The ondragover attrribute of the <div> element calls a function (dragoverHandler(ev)), that specifies where the dragged data can be dropped. By default, data/elements cannot be dropped in other elements. To allow a drop, we must prevent the default handling of the element. This is done by calling the preventDefault() method for the ondragover event: function dragoverHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); } Do the Drop - ondrop When the dragged data is dropped, a drop event occurs. In the example above, the ondrop attribute of the <div> element calls a function, dropHandler(event): function dropHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); const data = ev.dataTransfer.getData(\"text\"); ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data)); } Code explained: Call preventDefault() to prevent the browser default handling of the data (default is open as link on drop) Get the dragged data with the dataTransfer.getData() method. This method will return any data that was set to the same type in the setData() method The dragged data is the id of the dragged element (\"img1\") Append the dragged element into the drop element More Examples Example How to drag and drop an <h1> element to a <div> element: <script> function dragstartHandler(ev) { ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"text\", ev.target.id); } function dragoverHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); } function dropHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); const data = ev.dataTransfer.getData(\"text\"); ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data)); } </script> </head> <body> <div id=\"div1\" ondrop=\"dropHandler(event)\" ondragover=\"dragoverHandler(event)\"></div> <h1 id=\"h1\" draggable=\"true\" ondragstart=\"dragstartHandler(event)\">W3Schools.com</h1> Try it Yourself  Example How to drag and drop an <a> element to a <div> element: <script> function dragstartHandler(ev) { ev.dataTransfer.setData(\"text\", ev.target.id); } function dragoverHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); } function dropHandler(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); const data = ev.dataTransfer.getData(\"text\"); ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data)); } </script> </head> <body> <div id=\"div1\" ondrop=\"dropHandler(event)\" ondragover=\"dragoverHandler(event)\"></div> <a id=\"link1\" href=\"https://w3schools.com\" draggable=\"true\" ondragstart=\"dragstartHandler(event)\">W3Schools.com</a> Try it Yourself  Example How to drag and drop an image back and forth between two <div> elements: Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Use the style attribute with the width or height properties to specify the size of a table, row or column. HTML Table Width To set the width of a table, add the style attribute to the <table> element: Example Set the width of the table to 100%: <table style=\"width:100%\"> <tr> <th>Firstname</th> <th>Lastname</th> <th>Age</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Jill</td> <td>Smith</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Eve</td> <td>Jackson</td> <td>94</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  Note: Using a percentage as the size unit for a width means how wide will this element be compared to its parent element, which in this case is the <body> element. HTML Table Column Width To set the size of a specific column, add the style attribute on a <th> or <td> element: Example Set the width of the first column to 70%: <table style=\"width:100%\"> <tr> <th style=\"width:70%\">Firstname</th> <th>Lastname</th> <th>Age</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Jill</td> <td>Smith</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Eve</td> <td>Jackson</td> <td>94</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  HTML Table Row Height To set the height of a specific row, add the style attribute on a table row element: Example Set the height of the second row to 200 pixels: <table style=\"width:100%\"> <tr> <th>Firstname</th> <th>Lastname</th> <th>Age</th> </tr> <tr style=\"height:200px\"> <td>Jill</td> <td>Smith</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Eve</td> <td>Jackson</td> <td>94</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Image Maps The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags. Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below: Example Here is the HTML source code for the image map above: <img src=\"workplace.jpg\" alt=\"Workplace\" usemap=\"#workmap\"> <map name=\"workmap\"> <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"34,44,270,350\" alt=\"Computer\" href=\"computer.htm\"> <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"290,172,333,250\" alt=\"Phone\" href=\"phone.htm\"> <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"337,300,44\" alt=\"Coffee\" href=\"coffee.htm\"> </map> Try it Yourself  How Does it Work? The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click. To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas. The Image The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute: <img src=\"workplace.jpg\" alt=\"Workplace\" usemap=\"#workmap\"> The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map. Tip: You can use any image as an image map! Create Image Map Then, add a <map> element. The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute: <map name=\"workmap\"> The name attribute must have the same value as the <img> 's usemap attribute . The Areas Then, add the clickable areas. A clickable area is defined using an <area> element. Shape You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values: rect - defines a rectangular region circle - defines a circular region poly - defines a polygonal region default - defines the entire region You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. Shape=\"rect\" The coordinates for shape=\"rect\" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top: The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top: Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area: Example <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"34, 44, 270, 350\" href=\"computer.htm\"> Try it Yourself  This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page \"computer.htm\": Shape=\"circle\" To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle: 337,300 Then specify the radius of the circle: 44 pixels Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area: Example <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"337, 300, 44\" href=\"coffee.htm\"> Try it Yourself  This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page \"coffee.htm\": Shape=\"poly\" The shape=\"poly\" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon). This can be used to create any shape. Like maybe a croissant shape! How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link? We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant: The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis: Example <area shape=\"poly\" coords=\"140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147\" href=\"croissant.htm\"> Try it Yourself  This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page \"croissant.htm\": Image Map and JavaScript A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function. Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function: Example Here, we use the onclick attribute to execute a JavaScript function when the area is clicked: <map name=\"workmap\"> <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"337,300,44\" href=\"coffee.htm\" onclick=\"myFunction()\"> </map> <script> function myFunction() { alert(\"You clicked the coffee cup!\"); } </script> Try it Yourself  Chapter Summary Use the HTML <map> element to define an image map Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image map Use the HTML usemap attribute of the <img> element to point to an image map HTML Image Tags Tag Description <img> Defines an image <map> Defines an image map <area> Defines a clickable area inside an image map <picture> Defines a container for multiple image resources For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

The value Attribute The input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field: Example Input fields with initial (default) values: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The readonly Attribute The input readonly attribute specifies that an input field is read-only. A read-only input field cannot be modified (however, a user can tab to it, highlight it, and copy the text from it). The value of a read-only input field will be sent when submitting the form! Example A read-only input field: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\" readonly><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The disabled Attribute The input disabled attribute specifies that an input field should be disabled. A disabled input field is unusable and un-clickable. The value of a disabled input field will not be sent when submitting the form! Example A disabled input field: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\" disabled><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The size Attribute The input size attribute specifies the visible width, in characters, of an input field. The default value for size is 20. Note: The size attribute works with the following input types: text, search, tel, url, email, and password. Example Set a width for an input field: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" size=\"50\"><br> <label for=\"pin\">PIN:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"pin\" name=\"pin\" size=\"4\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The maxlength Attribute The input maxlength attribute specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field. Note: When a maxlength is set, the input field will not accept more than the specified number of characters. However, this attribute does not provide any feedback. So, if you want to alert the user, you must write JavaScript code. Example Set a maximum length for an input field: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" size=\"50\"><br> <label for=\"pin\">PIN:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"pin\" name=\"pin\" maxlength=\"4\" size=\"4\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The min and max Attributes The input min and max attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input field. The min and max attributes work with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week. Tip: Use the max and min attributes together to create a range of legal values. Example Set a max date, a min date, and a range of legal values: <form> <label for=\"datemax\">Enter a date before 1980-01-01:</label> <input type=\"date\" id=\"datemax\" name=\"datemax\" max=\"1979-12-31\"><br><br> <label for=\"datemin\">Enter a date after 2000-01-01:</label> <input type=\"date\" id=\"datemin\" name=\"datemin\" min=\"2000-01-02\"><br><br> <label for=\"quantity\">Quantity (between 1 and 5):</label> <input type=\"number\" id=\"quantity\" name=\"quantity\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The multiple Attribute The input multiple attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field. The multiple attribute works with the following input types: email, and file. Example A file upload field that accepts multiple values: <form> <label for=\"files\">Select files:</label> <input type=\"file\" id=\"files\" name=\"files\" multiple> </form> Try it Yourself  The pattern Attribute The input pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that the input field's value is checked against, when the form is submitted. The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password. Tip: Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user. Tip: Learn more about regular expressions in our JavaScript tutorial. Example An input field that can contain only three letters (no numbers or special characters): <form> <label for=\"country_code\">Country code:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"country_code\" name=\"country_code\" pattern=\"[A-Za-z]{3}\" title=\"Three letter country code\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The placeholder Attribute The input placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (a sample value or a short description of the expected format). The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value. The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, number, tel, email, and password. Example An input field with a placeholder text: <form> <label for=\"phone\">Enter a phone number:</label> <input type=\"tel\" id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" placeholder=\"123-45-678\" pattern=\"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The required Attribute The input required attribute specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form. The required attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, and file. Example A required input field: <form> <label for=\"username\">Username:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required> </form> Try it Yourself  The step Attribute The input step attribute specifies the legal number intervals for an input field. Example: if step=\"3\", legal numbers could be -3, 0, 3, 6, etc. Tip: This attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values. The step attribute works with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime-local, month, time and week. Example An input field with a specified legal number intervals: <form> <label for=\"points\">Points:</label> <input type=\"number\" id=\"points\" name=\"points\" step=\"3\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Note: Input restrictions are not foolproof, and JavaScript provides many ways to add illegal input. To safely restrict input, it must also be checked by the receiver (the server)! The autofocus Attribute The input autofocus attribute specifies that an input field should automatically get focus when the page loads. Example Let the \"First name\" input field automatically get focus when the page loads: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" autofocus><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The height and width Attributes The input height and width attributes specify the height and width of an <input type=\"image\"> element. Tip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load). Example Define an image as the submit button, with height and width attributes: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"><br><br> <input type=\"image\" src=\"img_submit.gif\" alt=\"Submit\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The list Attribute The input list attribute refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element. Example An <input> element with pre-defined values in a <datalist>: <form> <input list=\"browsers\"> <datalist id=\"browsers\"> <option value=\"Edge\"> <option value=\"Firefox\"> <option value=\"Chrome\"> <option value=\"Opera\"> <option value=\"Safari\"> </datalist> </form> Try it Yourself  The autocomplete Attribute The input autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or an input field should have autocomplete on or off. Autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the field, based on earlier typed values. The autocomplete attribute works with <form> and the following <input> types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color. Example An HTML form with autocomplete on, and off for one input field: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" autocomplete=\"on\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"><br><br> <label for=\"email\">Email:</label> <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" autocomplete=\"off\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Tip: In some browsers you may need to activate an autocomplete function for this to work (Look under \"Preferences\" in the browser's menu).

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. The id Attribute The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}. In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name \"myHeader\". This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> #myHeader { background-color: lightblue; color: black; padding: 40px; text-align: center; } </style> </head> <body> <h1 id=\"myHeader\">My Header</h1> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Note: The id name is case sensitive! Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.). Difference Between Class and ID A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page: Example <style> /* Style the element with the id \"myHeader\" */ #myHeader { background-color: lightblue; color: black; padding: 40px; text-align: center; } /* Style all elements with the class name \"city\" */ .city { background-color: tomato; color: white; padding: 10px; } </style> <!-- An element with a unique id --> <h1 id=\"myHeader\">My Cities</h1> <!-- Multiple elements with same class --> <h2 class=\"city\">London</h2> <p>London is the capital of England.</p> <h2 class=\"city\">Paris</h2> <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p> <h2 class=\"city\">Tokyo</h2> <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p> Try it Yourself  Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial . HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage. Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long. To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it. Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark. Example First, create a bookmark with the id attribute: <h2 id=\"C4\">Chapter 4</h2> Then, add a link to the bookmark (\"Jump to Chapter 4\"), from within the same page: Example <a href=\"#C4\">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Try it Yourself  Or, add a link to the bookmark (\"Jump to Chapter 4\"), from another page: <a href=\"html_demo.html#C4\">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Using the id Attribute in JavaScript The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element. JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method: Example Use the id attribute to manipulate text with JavaScript: <script> function displayResult() { document.getElementById(\"myHeader\").innerHTML = \"Have a nice day!\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  Tip: Study JavaScript in the HTML JavaScript chapter, or in our JavaScript Tutorial . Chapter Summary The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document The id attribute is used by CSS and JavaScript to style/select a specific element The value of the id attribute is case sensitive The id attribute is also used to create HTML bookmarks JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method Video: HTML ID  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

HTML Link Colors By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers): An unvisited link is underlined and blue A visited link is underlined and purple An active link is underlined and red You can change the link state colors, by using CSS: Example Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. A visited link will be pink with no underline. An active link will be yellow and underlined. In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined: <style> a:link { color: green; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:visited { color: pink; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; } a:hover { color: red; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } a:active { color: yellow; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: underline; } </style> Try it Yourself  Link Buttons A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS: This is a link Example <style> a:link, a:visited { background-color: #f44336; color: white; padding: 15px 25px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; } a:hover, a:active { background-color: red; } </style> Try it Yourself  To learn more about CSS, go to our CSS Tutorial .

Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code. Always Declare Document Type Always declare the document type as the first line in your document. The correct document type for HTML is: <!DOCTYPE html> Use Lowercase Element Names HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names. However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because: Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad Developers normally use lowercase names Lowercase looks cleaner Lowercase is easier to type Good: <body> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> Bad: <BODY> <P>This is a paragraph.</P> </BODY> Close All HTML Elements In HTML, you do not have to close all elements (for example the <p> element). However, we strongly recommend closing all HTML elements, like this: Good: <section> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </section> Bad: <section> <p>This is a paragraph. <p>This is a paragraph. </section> Use Lowercase Attribute Names HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in attribute names. However, we recommend using lowercase attribute names, because: Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad Developers normally use lowercase names Lowercase looks cleaner Lowercase is easier to type Good: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Bad: <a HREF=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Always Quote Attribute Values HTML allows attribute values without quotes. However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because: Developers normally quote attribute values Quoted values are easier to read You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces Good: <table class=\"striped\"> Bad: <table class=striped> Very bad: This will not work, because the value contains spaces: <table class=table striped> Always Specify alt, width, and height for Images Always specify the alt attribute for images. This attribute is important if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading. Good: <img src=\"html5.gif\" alt=\"HTML5\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px\"> Bad: <img src=\"html5.gif\"> Spaces and Equal Signs HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together. Good: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> Bad: <link rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \"styles.css\"> Avoid Long Code Lines When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code. Try to avoid too long code lines. Blank Lines and Indentation Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason. For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks. For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key. Good: <body> <h1>Famous Cities</h1> <h2>Tokyo</h2> <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom.</p> <h2>Paris</h2> <p>Paris is the capital of France. The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe.</p> </body> Bad: <body> <h1>Famous Cities</h1> <h2>Tokyo</h2><p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p> <h2>London</h2><p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom.</p> <h2>Paris</h2><p>Paris is the capital of France. The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe.</p> </body> Good Table Example: <table> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>A</td> <td>Description of A</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B</td> <td>Description of B</td> </tr> </table> Good List Example: <ul> <li>London</li> <li>Paris</li> <li>Tokyo</li> </ul> Never Skip the <title> Element The <title> element is required in HTML. The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results. The <title> element: defines a title in the browser toolbar provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites displays a title for the page in search-engine results So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible: <title>HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions</title> Omitting <html> and <body>? An HTML page will validate without the <html> and <body> tags: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <head> <title>Page Title</title> </head> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  However, we strongly recommend to always add the <html> and <body> tags! Omitting <body> can produce errors in older browsers. Omitting <html> and <body> can also crash DOM and XML software. Omitting <head>? The HTML <head> tag can also be omitted. Browsers will add all elements before <body> , to a default <head> element. Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <title>Page Title</title> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  However, we recommend using the <head> tag. Close Empty HTML Elements? In HTML, it is optional to close empty elements. Allowed: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> Also Allowed: <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML. Add the lang Attribute You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en-us\"> <head> <title>Page Title</title> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Meta Data To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and the character encoding <meta charset=\" charset \"> should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en-us\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Page Title</title> </head> Setting The Viewport The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference. Without the viewport meta tag With the viewport meta tag HTML Comments Short comments should be written on one line, like this: <!-- This is a comment --> Comments that spans more than one line, should be written like this: <!-- This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example. --> Long comments are easier to observe if they are indented with two spaces. Using Style Sheets Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets (the type attribute is not necessary): <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> Short CSS rules can be written compressed, like this: p.intro {font-family:Verdana;font-size:16em;} Long CSS rules should be written over multiple lines: body { background-color: lightgrey; font-family: \"Arial Black\", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16em; color: black; } Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector Use one space before the opening bracket Use two spaces of indentation Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces Loading JavaScript in HTML Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary): <script src=\"myscript.js\"> Accessing HTML Elements with JavaScript Using \"untidy\" HTML code can result in JavaScript errors. These two JavaScript statements will produce different results: Example getElementById(\"Demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello\"; getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello\"; Try it Yourself  Visit the JavaScript Style Guide . Use Lower Case File Names Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: \"london.jpg\" cannot be accessed as \"London.jpg\". Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: \"london.jpg\" can be accessed as \"London.jpg\". If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase, you have to be aware of this. If you move from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive server, even small errors will break your web! To avoid these problems, always use lowercase file names! File Extensions HTML files should have a .html extension ( .htm is allowed). CSS files should have a .css extension. JavaScript files should have a .js extension. Differences Between .htm and .html? There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions! Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server. Default Filenames When a URL does not specify a filename at the end (like \"https://www.w3schools.com/\"), the server just adds a default filename, such as \"index.html\", \"index.htm\", \"default.html\", or \"default.htm\". If your server is configured only with \"index.html\" as the default filename, your file must be named \"index.html\", and not \"default.html\". However, servers can be configured with more than one default filename; usually you can set up as many default filenames as you want.  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

The form Attribute The input form attribute specifies the form the <input> element belongs to. The value of this attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the <form> element it belongs to. Example An input field located outside of the HTML form (but still a part of the form): <form action=\"/action_page.php\" id=\"form1\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" form=\"form1\"> Try it Yourself  The formaction Attribute The input formaction attribute specifies the URL of the file that will process the input when the form is submitted. Note: This attribute overrides the action attribute of the <form> element. The formaction attribute works with the following input types: submit and image. Example An HTML form with two submit buttons, with different actions: <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> <input type=\"submit\" formaction=\"/action_page2.php\" value=\"Submit as Admin\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The formenctype Attribute The input formenctype attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitted (only for forms with method=\"post\"). Note: This attribute overrides the enctype attribute of the <form> element. The formenctype attribute works with the following input types: submit and image. Example A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with default encoding, the second sends the form-data encoded as \"multipart/form-data\": <form action=\"/action_page_binary.asp\" method=\"post\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> <input type=\"submit\" formenctype=\"multipart/form-data\" value=\"Submit as Multipart/form-data\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The formmethod Attribute The input formmethod attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL. Note: This attribute overrides the method attribute of the <form> element. The formmethod attribute works with the following input types: submit and image. The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method=\"get\") or as an HTTP post transaction (method=\"post\"). Notes on the \"get\" method: This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred Never use the \"get\" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar) Notes on the \"post\" method: This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction Form submissions with the \"post\" method cannot be bookmarked The \"post\" method is more robust and secure than \"get\", and \"post\" does not have size limitations Example A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with method=\"get\". The second sends the form-data with method=\"post\": <form action=\"/action_page.php\" method=\"get\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit using GET\"> <input type=\"submit\" formmethod=\"post\" value=\"Submit using POST\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The formtarget Attribute The input formtarget attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. Note: This attribute overrides the target attribute of the <form> element. The formtarget attribute works with the following input types: submit and image. Example A form with two submit buttons, with different target windows: <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> <input type=\"submit\" formtarget=\"_blank\" value=\"Submit to a new window/tab\"> </form> Try it Yourself  The formnovalidate Attribute The input formnovalidate attribute specifies that an <input> element should not be validated when submitted. Note: This attribute overrides the novalidate attribute of the <form> element. The formnovalidate attribute works with the following input types: submit.

Example Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Try it Yourself  HTML Headings HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading. Example <h1>Heading 1</h1> <h2>Heading 2</h2> <h3>Heading 3</h3> <h4>Heading 4</h4> <h5>Heading 5</h5> <h6>Heading 6</h6> Try it Yourself  Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading. Headings Are Important Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3> , and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold . Bigger Headings Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property: Example <h1 style=\"font-size:60px;\">Heading 1</h1> Try it Yourself  HTML Tag Reference W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

HTML Iframe Syntax The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. Syntax <iframe src=\" url \" title=\" description \"></iframe> Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe> . This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is. Iframe - Set Height and Width Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe. The height and width are specified in pixels by default: Example <iframe src=\"demo_iframe.htm\" height=\"200\" width=\"300\" title=\"Iframe Example\"></iframe> Try it Yourself  Or you can add the style attribute and use the CSS height and width properties: Example <iframe src=\"demo_iframe.htm\" style=\"height:200px;width:300px;\" title=\"Iframe Example\"></iframe> Try it Yourself  Iframe - Remove the Border By default, an iframe has a border around it. To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property: Example <iframe src=\"demo_iframe.htm\" style=\"border:none;\" title=\"Iframe Example\"></iframe> Try it Yourself  With CSS, you can also change the size, style and color of the iframe's border: Example <iframe src=\"demo_iframe.htm\" style=\"border:2px solid red;\" title=\"Iframe Example\"></iframe> Try it Yourself  Iframe - Target for a Link An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.

Example Here is a quote from WWF's website: For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live. Try it Yourself  HTML <blockquote> for Quotations The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements. Example <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p> <blockquote cite=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html\"> For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live. </blockquote> Try it Yourself  HTML <q> for Short Quotations The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation. Example <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p> Try it Yourself  HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like \"HTML\", \"CSS\", \"Mr.\", \"Dr.\", \"ASAP\", \"ATM\". Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines. Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. Example <p>The <abbr title=\"World Health Organization\">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <address> for Contact Information The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article. The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc. The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element. Example <address> Written by John Doe.<br> Visit us at:<br> Example.com<br> Box 564, Disneyland<br> USA </address> Try it Yourself  HTML <cite> for Work Title The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.). Note: A person's name is not the title of a work. The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic . Example <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override. The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction: Example <bdo dir=\"rtl\">This text will be written from right to left</bdo> Try it Yourself  HTML Quotation and Citation Elements Tag Description <abbr> Defines an abbreviation or acronym <address> Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document <bdo> Defines the text direction <blockquote> Defines a section that is quoted from another source <cite> Defines the title of a work <q> Defines a short inline quotation For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

Combine Vertical and Horizontal Zebra Stripes You can combine the styling from the two examples above and you will have stripes on every other row and every other column. If you use a transparent color you will get an overlapping effect. Use an rgba() color to specify the transparency of the color: Example tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: rgba(150, 212, 212, 0.4); } th:nth-child(even),td:nth-child(even) { background-color: rgba(150, 212, 212, 0.4); } Try it Yourself  Horizontal Dividers First Name Last Name Savings Peter Griffin $100 Lois Griffin $150 Joe Swanson $300 If you specify borders only at the bottom of each table row, you will have a table with horizontal dividers.

Each group is specified with a <col> element. The span attribute specifies how many columns get the style. The style attribute specifies the style to give the columns. Note: There is a very limited selection of legal CSS properties for colgroups . Example <table> <colgroup> <col span=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #D6EEEE\"> </colgroup> <tr> <th>MON</th> <th>TUE</th> <th>WED</th> <th>THU</th> ... Try it Yourself  Note: The <colgroup> tag must be a child of a <table> element and should be placed before any other table elements, like <thead> , <tr> , <td> etc., but after the <caption> element, if present. Legal CSS Properties There is only a very limited selection of CSS properties that are allowed to be used in the colgroup: width property visibility property background properties border properties All other CSS properties will have no effect on your tables. Multiple Col Elements If you want to style multiple columns with different styles, use more than one <col> element inside the <colgroup> : Example <table> <colgroup> <col span=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #D6EEEE\"> <col span=\"3\" style=\"background-color: pink\"> </colgroup> <tr> <th>MON</th> <th>TUE</th> <th>WED</th> <th>THU</th> ...

How To Add a Favicon in HTML You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc . Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast. A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab, like this: To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is \"favicon.ico\". Next, add a <link> element to your \"index.html\" file, after the <title> element, like this: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My Page Title</title> <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/images/favicon.ico\"> </head> <body> <h1>This is a Heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Now, save the \"index.html\" file and reload it in your browser. Your browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the page title. Favicon File Format Support The following table shows the file format support for a favicon image: Browser ICO PNG GIF JPEG SVG Edge Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Chrome Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Firefox Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Opera Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Safari Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Chapter Summary Use the HTML <link> element to insert a favicon HTML Link Tag Tag Description <link> Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

The two most common display values are block and inline. Block-level Elements A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div> . The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document. The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <p> element is a block-level element. The <div> element is a block-level element. Example <p>Hello World</p> <div>Hello World</div> Try it Yourself  Here are the block-level elements in HTML: <address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video> Inline Elements An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. Example <span>Hello World</span> Try it Yourself  Here are the inline elements in HTML: <a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> <object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var> Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element! The <div> Element The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The <div> element has no required attributes, but style , class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: Example <div style=\"background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;\"> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Try it Yourself  You will learn more about the <div> element in the next chapter . The <span> Element The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> element has no required attributes, but style , class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: Example <p>My mother has <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold;\">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style=\"color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;\">dark green</span> eyes.</p> Try it Yourself  Chapter Summary A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary The <div> element is a block-level element and is often used as a container for other HTML elements The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document HTML Tags Tag Description <div> Defines a section in a document (block-level) <span> Defines a section in a document (inline) For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

The HTML <head> Element The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed on the page. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information. The HTML <title> Element The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The <title> element is required in HTML documents! The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results. The <title> element: defines a title in the browser toolbar provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites displays a title for the page in search engine-results So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible! A simple HTML document: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title> </head> <body> The content of the document...... </body> </html> Try it Yourself  The HTML <style> Element The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page: Example <style> body {background-color: powderblue;} h1 {color: red;} p {color: blue;} </style> Try it Yourself  The HTML <link> Element The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets: Example <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"mystyle.css\"> Try it Yourself  Tip: To learn all about CSS, visit our CSS Tutorial . The HTML <meta> Element The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services. Examples Define the character set used: <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> Define keywords for search engines: <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"HTML, CSS, JavaScript\"> Define a description of your web page: <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Free Web tutorials\"> Define the author of a page: <meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\"> Refresh document every 30 seconds: <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"30\"> Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> Example of <meta> tags: Example <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Free Web tutorials\"> <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"HTML, CSS, JavaScript\"> <meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\"> Try it Yourself  Setting The Viewport The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference. Without the viewport meta tag With the viewport meta tag The HTML <script> Element The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts. The following JavaScript writes \"Hello JavaScript!\" into an HTML element with id=\"demo\": Example <script> function myFunction() { document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  Tip: To learn all about JavaScript, visit our JavaScript Tutorial . The HTML <base> Element The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page. The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both. There can only be one single <base> element in a document! Example Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page: <head> <base href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> </head> <body> <img src=\"images/stickman.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"39\" alt=\"Stickman\"> <a href=\"tags/tag_base.asp\">HTML base Tag</a> </body> Try it Yourself  Chapter Summary The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag The <title> element is required and it defines the title of the document The <style> element is used to define style information for a single document The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page HTML head Elements Tag Description <head> Defines information about the document <title> Defines the title of a document <base> Defines a default address or a default target for all links on a page <link> Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource <meta> Defines metadata about an HTML document <script> Defines a client-side script <style> Defines style information for a document For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML. Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) Windows 8 or later: Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad . Windows 7 or earlier: Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac) Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose \"Plain Text\" Then under \"Open and Save\", check the box that says \"Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text\". Then open a new document to place the code. Step 2: Write Some HTML Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Step 3: Save the HTML Page Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu. Name the file \"index.htm\" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files). Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference; it is up to you. Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose \"Open with\"). The result will look much like this: W3Schools Online Editor - \"Try it Yourself\" With our free online editor, you can edit the HTML code and view the result in your browser. It is the perfect tool when you want to test code fast. It also has color coding and the ability to save and share code with others: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Page Title</title> </head> <body> <h1>This is a Heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Click on the \"Try it Yourself\" button to see how it works.

Plug-ins Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes: To run Java applets To run Microsoft ActiveX controls To display Flash movies To display maps To scan for viruses To verify a bank id Warning ! Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins. ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers. The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers. The <object> Element The <object> element is supported by all browsers. The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document. It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML: Example <object width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" data=\"snippet.html\"></object> Try it Yourself  Or images if you like: Example <object data=\"audi.jpeg\"></object> Try it Yourself  The <embed> Element The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers. The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document. Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5. Example <embed src=\"audi.jpeg\"> Try it Yourself  Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

The user input is most often sent to a server for processing. Example First name: Last name: Try it Yourself  The <form> Element The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input: <form> . form elements . </form> The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc. All the different form elements are covered in this chapter: HTML Form Elements . The <input> Element The HTML <input> element is the most used form element. An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute. Here are some examples: Type Description <input type=\"text\"> Displays a single-line text input field <input type=\"radio\"> Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices) <input type=\"checkbox\"> Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices) <input type=\"submit\"> Displays a submit button (for submitting the form) <input type=\"button\"> Displays a clickable button All the different input types are covered in this chapter: HTML Input Types . Text Fields The <input type=\"text\"> defines a single-line input field for text input. Example A form with input fields for text: <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: First name: Last name: Note: The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width of an input field is 20 characters. The <label> Element Notice the use of the <label> element in the example above. The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements. The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element. The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox. The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. Radio Buttons The <input type=\"radio\"> defines a radio button. Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices. Example A form with radio buttons: <p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p> <form> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"html\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"HTML\"> <label for=\"html\">HTML</label><br> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"css\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"CSS\"> <label for=\"css\">CSS</label><br> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"javascript\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"JavaScript\"> <label for=\"javascript\">JavaScript</label> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: Choose your favorite Web language: HTML CSS JavaScript Checkboxes The <input type=\"checkbox\"> defines a checkbox . Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices. Example A form with checkboxes: <form> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle1\" name=\"vehicle1\" value=\"Bike\"> <label for=\"vehicle1\"> I have a bike</label><br> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle2\" name=\"vehicle2\" value=\"Car\"> <label for=\"vehicle2\"> I have a car</label><br> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle3\" name=\"vehicle3\" value=\"Boat\"> <label for=\"vehicle3\"> I have a boat</label> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: I have a bike I have a car I have a boat The Submit Button The <input type=\"submit\"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler. The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data. The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute. Example A form with a submit button: <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: First name: Last name: The Name Attribute for <input> Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted. If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all. Example This example will not submit the value of the \"First name\" input field: <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Video: HTML Forms  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not. They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set. UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. The HTML charset Attribute To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page. This is specified in the <meta> tag: <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML. UTF-8 Characters Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers): A is 65 B is 66 C is 67 Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <body> <p>I will display A B C</p> <p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Example Explained The <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> element defines the character set. The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67. To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon). Emoji Characters Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet:  is 128516  is 128525  is 128151 Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <body> <h1>My First Emoji</h1> <p>&#128512;</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML. Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <body> <h1>Sized Emojis</h1> <p style=\"font-size:48px\"> &#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151; </p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags. Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters. Entity names look like this: & entity_name ; Entity numbers look like this: &# entity_number ; To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers. Non-breaking Space A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp; A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line. Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Examples:  10 10 km/h 10 PM Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity. The non-breaking hyphen ( &#8209; ) is used to define a hyphen character () that does not break into a new line. Some Useful HTML Character Entities Result Description Name Number non-breaking space &nbsp; &#160; Try it  < less than &lt; &#60; Try it  > greater than &gt; &#62; Try it  & ampersand &amp; &#38; Try it  \" double quotation mark &quot; &#34; Try it  ' single quotation mark &apos; &#39; Try it   cent &cent; &#162; Try it   pound &pound; &#163; Try it   yen &yen; &#165; Try it   euro &euro; &#8364; Try it   copyright &copy; &#169; Try it   registered trademark &reg; &#174; Try it   trademark &trade; &#8482; Try it  Note Entity names are case sensitive. Combining Diacritical Marks A diacritical mark is a \"glyph\" added to a letter. Some diacritical marks, like grave ( ) and acute ( ) are called accents. Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page. Here are some examples: Mark Character Construct Result  a a&#768; a Try it   a a&#769; a Try it   a a&#770; a Try it   a a&#771; a Try it   O O&#768; O Try it   O O&#769; O Try it   O O&#770; O Try it   O O&#771; O Try it  There are more examples in the next chapter.

Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets messages/updates from a server. Normally, a web page has to request data from the server, but with server-sent events, the updates are pushed automatically. Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock market updates, news feeds, sport results, etc. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support the Server-Sent Events API. API SSE 6.0 79.0 6.0 5.0 11.5 Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications: Example <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); // Check browser support for SSE if(typeof(EventSource) !== \"undefined\") { var source = new EventSource(\"demo_sse.php\"); source.onmessage = function(event) { x.innerHTML += event.data + \"<br>\"; }; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no support for server-sent events.\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  Example explained: Create a new EventSource object, and specify the URL of the page sending the updates (in this example \"demo_sse.php\") Each time an update is received, the onmessage event occurs When an onmessage event occurs, put the received data into the element with id=\"result\" Check Browser Support In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to check browser support for server-sent events: if(typeof(EventSource) !== \"undefined\") { // Yes! Server-sent events support! // Some code..... } else { // Sorry! No server-sent events support.. } Server-Side Code Example For the example above to work, you need a server capable of sending data updates (like PHP or ASP). The server-side event stream syntax is simple. Set the \"Content-Type\" header to \"text/event-stream\". Now you can start sending event streams. Code in PHP (demo_sse.php): <?php header('Content-Type: text/event-stream'); header('Cache-Control: no-cache'); $time = date('r'); echo \"data: The server time is: {$time}nn\"; flush(); ?> Code in ASP (VB) (demo_sse.asp): <% Response.ContentType = \"text/event-stream\" Response.Expires = -1 Response.Write(\"data: The server time is: \" & now()) Response.Flush() %> Code explained: Set the \"Content-Type\" header to \"text/event-stream\" Specify that the page should not cache Output the data to send ( Always start with \"data: \") Flush the output data back to the web page The EventSource Object In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available: Events Description onopen When a connection to the server is opened onmessage When a message is received onerror When an error occurs  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet. HTML Documents All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> . The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html> . The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body> . Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html> HTML Headings HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: Example <h1>This is heading 1</h1> <h2>This is heading 2</h2> <h3>This is heading 3</h3> Try it Yourself  HTML Paragraphs HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: Example <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is another paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML Links HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: Example <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com\">This is a link</a> Try it Yourself  The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter. HTML Images HTML images are defined with the <img> tag. The source file ( src ), alternative text ( alt ), width , and height are provided as attributes: Example <img src=\"w3schools.jpg\" alt=\"W3Schools.com\" width=\"104\" height=\"142\"> Try it Yourself  How to View HTML Source Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered \"Hey! How did they do that?\" View HTML Source Code: Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select \"View Page Source\". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page. Inspect an HTML Element: Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose \"Inspect\" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

How To Add a Border To add a border, use the CSS border property on table , th , and td elements: Example table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; } Try it Yourself  Collapsed Table Borders To avoid having double borders like in the example above, set the CSS border-collapse property to collapse . This will make the borders collapse into a single border: Example table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; } Try it Yourself  Style Table Borders If you set a background color of each cell, and give the border a white color (the same as the document background), you get the impression of an invisible border: Example table, th, td { border: 1px solid white; border-collapse: collapse; } th, td { background-color: #96D4D4; } Try it Yourself  Round Table Borders With the border-radius property, the borders get rounded corners: Example table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px; } Try it Yourself  Skip the border around the table by leaving out table from the css selector: Example th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 10px; } Try it Yourself  Dotted Table Borders With the border-style property, you can set the appearance of the border. The following values are allowed: dotted dashed solid double groove ridge inset outset none hidden Example th, td { border-style: dotted; } Try it Yourself  Border Color With the border-color property, you can set the color of the border.

Example <code> x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; </code> Try it Yourself  HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input The HTML <kbd> element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. Example Define some text as keyboard input in a document: <p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p> Result: Save the document by pressing Ctrl + S Try it Yourself  HTML <samp> For Program Output The HTML <samp> element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. Example Define some text as sample output from a computer program in a document: <p>Message from my computer:</p> <p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p> Result: Message from my computer: File not found. Press F1 to continue Try it Yourself  HTML <code> For Computer Code The HTML <code> element is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. Example Define some text as computer code in a document: <code> x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; </code> Result: x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; Try it Yourself  Preserve Line-Breaks Notice that the <code> element does NOT preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks. To preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element: Example <pre> <code> x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; </code> </pre> Result: x = 5; y = 6; z = x + y; Try it Yourself  HTML <var> For Variables The HTML <var> element is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Example Define some text as variables in a document: <p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p> Result: The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x b x h , where b is the base, and h is the vertical height.

The HTML <audio> Element To play an audio file in HTML, use the <audio> element: Example <audio controls> <source src=\"horse.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"> <source src=\"horse.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> Try it Yourself  HTML Audio - How It Works The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume. The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format. The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element. HTML <audio> Autoplay To start an audio file automatically, use the autoplay attribute: Example <audio controls autoplay> <source src=\"horse.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"> <source src=\"horse.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> Try it Yourself  Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted): Example <audio controls autoplay muted> <source src=\"horse.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"> <source src=\"horse.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> Try it Yourself  Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the <audio> element.

What is HTML Web Storage? With web storage, applications can store data locally within the user's browser. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server. Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data. Web Storage API Objects Web storage provides two objects for storing data in the browser: window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date (data is not lost when the browser tab is closed) window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed) Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Web Storage. API localStorage 4.0 8.0 3.5 4.0 11.5 sessionStorage 4.0 8.0 3.5 4.0 11.5 Test Web Storage API Support Before using web storage, we can quickly check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage: Example Test browser support: <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if (typeof(Storage) !== \"undefined\") { x.innerHTML = \"Your browser supports Web storage!\"; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no Web storage support!\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  The localStorage Object The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The data will not be lost when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year. Example Use localStorage to set and retrieve name and value pairs: <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if (typeof(Storage) !== \"undefined\") { // Store localStorage.setItem(\"lastname\", \"Smith\"); localStorage.setItem(\"bgcolor\", \"yellow\"); // Retrieve x.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem(\"lastname\"); x.style.backgroundColor = localStorage.getItem(\"bgcolor\"); } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no Web storage support!\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  Example explained: Use the localStorage.setItem() method to create name/value pairs Use the localStorage.getItem() method to retrieve the values set Retrieve the value of \"lastname\" and insert it into an element with id=\"result\" Retrieve the value of \"bgcolor\" and insert it into the style backgroundColor of the element with id=\"result\" The syntax for removing the \"lastname\" localStorage item is as follows: localStorage.removeItem(\"lastname\"); Note: Name/value pairs are always stored as strings. Remember to convert them to another format when needed! Counting Clicks with localStorage The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button. In this code the value string is converted to a number to be able to increase the counter: Example <script> function clickCounter() { const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if (typeof(Storage) !== \"undefined\") { if (localStorage.clickcount) { localStorage.clickcount = Number(localStorage.clickcount)+1; } else { localStorage.clickcount = 1; } x.innerHTML = \"You have clicked the button \" + localStorage.clickcount + \" time(s)!\"; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no Web storage support!\"; } } </script> Try it Yourself  The sessionStorage Object The sessionStorage object is equal to the localStorage object, except that it stores the data for only one session! The data is deleted when the user closes the specific browser tab. Counting Clicks with sessionStorage The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button, in the current session: Example <script> function clickCounter() { const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if (typeof(Storage) !== \"undefined\") { if (sessionStorage.clickcount) { sessionStorage.clickcount = Number(sessionStorage.clickcount)+1; } else { sessionStorage.clickcount = 1; } x.innerHTML = \"You have clicked the button \" + sessionStorage.clickcount + \" time(s) in this session!\"; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, no Web storage support!\"; } } </script> Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. The class Attribute The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name. In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of \"city\". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> .city { background-color: tomato; color: white; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\"city\"> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital of England.</p> </div> <div class=\"city\"> <h2>Paris</h2> <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p> </div> <div class=\"city\"> <h2>Tokyo</h2> <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p> </div> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of \"note\". Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> .note { font-size: 120%; color: red; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>My <span class=\"note\">Important</span> Heading</h1> <p>This is some <span class=\"note\">important</span> text.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. Note: The class name is case sensitive! Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial . The Syntax For Class To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}: Example Create a class named \"city\": <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> .city { background-color: tomato; color: white; padding: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h2 class=\"city\">London</h2> <p>London is the capital of England.</p> <h2 class=\"city\">Paris</h2> <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p> <h2 class=\"city\">Tokyo</h2> <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Multiple Classes HTML elements can belong to more than one class. To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class=\"city main\">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified. In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: Example <h2 class=\"city main\">London</h2> <h2 class=\"city\">Paris</h2> <h2 class=\"city\">Tokyo</h2> Try it Yourself  Different Elements Can Share Same Class Different HTML elements can point to the same class name. In the following example, both <h2> and <p> point to the \"city\" class and will share the same style: Example <h2 class=\"city\">Paris</h2> <p class=\"city\">Paris is the capital of France</p> Try it Yourself  Use of the class Attribute in JavaScript The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements. JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method: Example Click on a button to hide all elements with the class name \"city\": <script> function myFunction() { var x = document.getElementsByClassName(\"city\") ; for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x[i].style.display = \"none\"; } } </script> Try it Yourself  Don't worry if you don't understand the code in the example above. You will learn more about JavaScript in our HTML JavaScript chapter, or you can study our JavaScript Tutorial . Chapter Summary The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements The class attribute can be used on any HTML element The class name is case sensitive Different HTML elements can point to the same class name JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method Video: HTML Class  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

HTML Paragraphs The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. Example <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is another paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML Display You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed: Example <p> This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it. </p> <p> This paragraph contains a lot of spaces in the source code, but the browser ignores it. </p> Try it Yourself  HTML Horizontal Rules The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: Example <h1>This is heading 1</h1> <p>This is some text.</p> <hr> <h2>This is heading 2</h2> <p>This is some other text.</p> <hr> Try it Yourself  The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. HTML Line Breaks The HTML <br> element defines a line break. Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: Example <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p> Try it Yourself  The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. The Poem Problem This poem will display on a single line: Example <p> My Bonnie lies over the ocean. My Bonnie lies over the sea. My Bonnie lies over the ocean. Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. </p> Try it Yourself  Solution - The HTML <pre> Element The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: Example <pre> My Bonnie lies over the ocean. My Bonnie lies over the sea. My Bonnie lies over the ocean. Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. </pre> Try it Yourself  HTML Tag Reference W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about HTML elements and their attributes.

With Padding hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello With Spacing hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello HTML Table - Cell Padding Cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content. By default the padding is set to 0. To add padding on table cells, use the CSS padding property: Example th, td { padding: 15px; } Try it Yourself  To add padding only above the content, use the padding-top property. Add padding to the other sides with the padding-bottom , padding-left , and padding-right properties: Example th, td { padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 40px; } Try it Yourself  HTML Table - Cell Spacing Cell spacing is the space between each cell. By default the space is set to 2 pixels.

The Action Attribute The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called \"action_page.php\". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data: Example On submit, send form data to \"action_page.php\": <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page. The Target Attribute The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. The target attribute can have one of the following values: Value Description _blank The response is displayed in a new window or tab _self The response is displayed in the current window _parent The response is displayed in the parent frame _top The response is displayed in the full body of the window framename The response is displayed in a named iframe The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window. Example Here, the submitted result will open in a new browser tab: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" target=\"_blank\"> Try it Yourself  The Method Attribute The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method=\"get\" ) or as HTTP post transaction (with method=\"post\" ). The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. Example This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" method=\"get\"> Try it Yourself  Example This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" method=\"post\"> Try it Yourself  Notes on GET: Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!) The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters) Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google Notes on POST: Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL) POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data. Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information! The Autocomplete Attribute The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off. When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. Example A form with autocomplete on: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" autocomplete=\"on\"> Try it Yourself  The Novalidate Attribute The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. Example A form with a novalidate attribute: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" novalidate> Try it Yourself  List of All <form> Attributes Attribute Description accept-charset Specifies the character encodings used for form submission action Specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted autocomplete Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off enctype Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server (only for method=\"post\") method Specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data name Specifies the name of the form novalidate Specifies that the form should not be validated when submitted rel Specifies the relationship between a linked resource and the current document target Specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code. Add Comments With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code: Example <!-- This is a comment --> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- Remember to add more information here --> Try it Yourself  Hide Content Comments can be used to hide content. This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily: Example <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> --> <p>This is a paragraph too.</p> Try it Yourself  You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display. Example Hide a section of HTML code: <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- <p>Look at this cool image:</p> <img border=\"0\" src=\"pic_trulli.jpg\" alt=\"Trulli\"> --> <p>This is a paragraph too.</p> Try it Yourself  Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. Hide Inline Content Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.

A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50). Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers. URL - Uniform Resource Locator Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL. A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web. A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules: scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename Explanation: scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https ) prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www ) domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com) port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80 ) path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site) filename - defines the name of a document or resource Common URL Schemes The table below lists some common schemes: Scheme Short for Used for http HyperText Transfer Protocol Common web pages. Not encrypted https Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure web pages. Encrypted ftp File Transfer Protocol Downloading or uploading files file A file on your computer URL Encoding URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set . If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted. URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a \"%\" followed by hexadecimal digits. URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20. Try It Yourself If you click \"Submit\", the browser will URL encode the input before it is sent to the server. A page at the server will display the received input. Try some other input and click Submit again. ASCII Encoding Examples Your browser will encode input, according to the character-set used in your page. The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8. Character From Windows-1252 From UTF-8  %80 %E2%82%AC  %A3 %C2%A3  %A9 %C2%A9  %AE %C2%AE À %C0 %C3%80 Á %C1 %C3%81 Â %C2 %C3%82 Ã %C3 %C3%83 Ä %C4 %C3%84 Å %C5 %C3%85 For a complete reference of all URL encodings, visit our URL Encoding Reference .

A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports. What is Responsive Web Design? Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones): Try it Yourself  Setting The Viewport To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages: Example <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> Try it Yourself  This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Without the viewport meta tag: With the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page on a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference. Responsive Images Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. Using the width Property If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" > Try it Yourself  Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. Using the max-width Property If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" style=\" max-width:100%; height:auto;\"> Try it Yourself  Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. Resize the browser window to see how the image below changes depending on the width: Example <picture> <source srcset=\"img_smallflower.jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 600px)\"> <source srcset=\"img_flowers.jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 1500px)\"> <source srcset=\"flowers.jpg\"> <img src=\"img_smallflower.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers\"> </picture> Try it Yourself  Responsive Text Size The text size can be set with a \"vw\" unit, which means the \"viewport width\". That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window: Hello World Resize the browser window to see how the text size scales. Example <h1 style=\" font-size:10vw \">Hello World</h1> Try it Yourself  Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm. Media Queries In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages. With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes. Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on small screens: Left Menu Main Content Right Content Example <style> .left, .right { float: left; width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */ } .main { float: left; width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */ } /* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */ @media screen and (max-width: 800px) { .left, .main, .right { width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */ } } </style> Try it Yourself  Tip: To learn more about Media Queries and Responsive Web Design, read our RWD Tutorial .

Example Company Contact Country Alfreds Futterkiste Maria Anders Germany Centro comercial Moctezuma Francisco Chang Mexico Ernst Handel Roland Mendel Austria Island Trading Helen Bennett UK Laughing Bacchus Winecellars Yoshi Tannamuri Canada Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti Giovanni Rovelli Italy Try it Yourself  Define an HTML Table A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns. Example A simple HTML table: <table> <tr> <th>Company</th> <th>Contact</th> <th>Country</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td> <td>Maria Anders</td> <td>Germany</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td> <td>Francisco Chang</td> <td>Mexico</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  Table Cells Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag. td stands for table data. Everything between <td> and </td> is the content of a table cell. Example <table> <tr> <td>Emil</td> <td>Tobias</td> <td>Linus</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  Note: A table cell can contain all sorts of HTML elements: text, images, lists, links, other tables, etc. Table Rows Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag. tr stands for table row. Example <table> <tr> <td>Emil</td> <td>Tobias</td> <td>Linus</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>14</td> <td>10</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  You can have as many rows as you like in a table; just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row. Note: There are times when a row can have less or more cells than another. You will learn about that in a later chapter. Table Headers Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag: th stands for table header. Example Let the first row be table header cells: <table> <tr> <th>Person 1</th> <th>Person 2</th> <th>Person 3</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Emil</td> <td>Tobias</td> <td>Linus</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>14</td> <td>10</td> </tr> </table> Try it Yourself  By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS. HTML Table Tags Tag Description <table> Defines a table <th> Defines a header cell in a table <tr> Defines a row in a table <td> Defines a cell in a table <caption> Defines a table caption <colgroup> Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting <col> Specifies column properties for each column within a <colgroup> element <thead> Groups the header content in a table <tbody> Groups the body content in a table <tfoot> Groups the footer content in a table For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

The <div> Element The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after. Example A <div> element takes up all available width: Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet. Result Lorem Ipsum I am a div dolor sit amet. Try it Yourself  The <div> element has no required attributes, but style , class and id are common. <div> as a container The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together. Example A <div> element with HTML elements: <div> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England.</p> <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Center align a <div> element If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto . Example <style> div { width:300px; margin:auto; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Multiple <div> elements You can have many <div> containers on the same page. Example <div> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England.</p> <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p> </div> <div> <h2>Oslo</h2> <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p> <p>Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.</p> </div> <div> <h2>Rome</h2> <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p> <p>Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Aligning <div> elements side by side When building web pages, you often want to have two or more <div> elements side by side, like this: London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. There are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all include some CSS styling. We will look at the most common methods: Float The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years. The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. Example How to use float to align div elements side by side: <style> .mycontainer { width:100%; overflow:auto; } .mycontainer div { width:33%; float:left; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Learn more about float in our CSS float tutorial . Inline-block If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block , the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other. Example How to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side: <style> div { width: 30%; display: inline-block; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Flex The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container. Example How to use flex to align div elements side by side: <style> .mycontainer { display: flex; } .mycontainer > div { width:33%; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Learn more about flex in our CSS flexbox tutorial . Grid The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually. The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column. Example How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side: <style> .grid-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.

Struggling with Video Formats? Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming. An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page. YouTube Video Id YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video. You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code. Playing a YouTube Video in HTML To play your video on a web page, do the following: Upload the video to YouTube Take a note of the video id Define an <iframe> element in your web page Let the src attribute point to the video URL Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player Add any other parameters to the URL (see below) Example <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY\"> </iframe> Try it Yourself  YouTube Autoplay + Mute You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors! Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted). YouTube - Autoplay + Muted <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1\"> </iframe> Try it Yourself  YouTube Playlist A comma separated list of videos to play (in addition to the original URL).

The HTML <form> Elements The HTML <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements: <input> <label> <select> <textarea> <button> <fieldset> <legend> <datalist> <output> <option> <optgroup> The <input> Element One of the most used form elements is the <input> element. The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute. Example <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"> Try it Yourself  All the different values of the type attribute are covered in the next chapter: HTML Input Types . The <label> Element The <label> element defines a label for several form elements. The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element. The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox. The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. The <select> Element The <select> element defines a drop-down list: Example <label for=\"cars\">Choose a car:</label> <select id=\"cars\" name=\"cars\"> <option value=\"volvo\">Volvo</option> <option value=\"saab\">Saab</option> <option value=\"fiat\">Fiat</option> <option value=\"audi\">Audi</option> </select> Try it Yourself  The <option> element defines an option that can be selected. By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected. To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option: Example <option value=\"fiat\" selected>Fiat</option> Try it Yourself  Visible Values: Use the size attribute to specify the number of visible values: Example <label for=\"cars\">Choose a car:</label> <select id=\"cars\" name=\"cars\" size=\"3\"> <option value=\"volvo\">Volvo</option> <option value=\"saab\">Saab</option> <option value=\"fiat\">Fiat</option> <option value=\"audi\">Audi</option> </select> Try it Yourself  Allow Multiple Selections: Use the multiple attribute to allow the user to select more than one value: Example <label for=\"cars\">Choose a car:</label> <select id=\"cars\" name=\"cars\" size=\"4\" multiple> <option value=\"volvo\">Volvo</option> <option value=\"saab\">Saab</option> <option value=\"fiat\">Fiat</option> <option value=\"audi\">Audi</option> </select> Try it Yourself  The <textarea> Element The <textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area): Example <textarea name=\"message\" rows=\"10\" cols=\"30\"> The cat was playing in the garden. </textarea> Try it Yourself  The rows attribute specifies the visible number of lines in a text area. The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area. This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: The cat was playing in the garden. You can also define the size of the text area by using CSS: Example <textarea name=\"message\" style=\"width:200px; height:600px;\"> The cat was playing in the garden. </textarea> Try it Yourself  The <button> Element The <button> element defines a clickable button: Example <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"alert('Hello World!')\">Click Me!</button> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: Click Me! Note: Always specify the type attribute for the button element. Different browsers may use different default types for the button element. The <fieldset> and <legend> Elements The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form. The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element. Example <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <fieldset> <legend>Personalia:</legend> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </fieldset> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: Personalia: First name: Last name: The <datalist> Element The <datalist> element specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element. Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data. The list attribute of the <input> element, must refer to the id attribute of the <datalist> element. Example <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <input list=\"browsers\"> <datalist id=\"browsers\"> <option value=\"Edge\"> <option value=\"Firefox\"> <option value=\"Chrome\"> <option value=\"Opera\"> <option value=\"Safari\"> </datalist> </form> Try it Yourself  The <output> Element The <output> element represents the result of a calculation (like one performed by a script). Example Perform a calculation and show the result in an <output> element: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" oninput=\"x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)\"> 0 <input type=\"range\" id=\"a\" name=\"a\" value=\"50\"> 100 + <input type=\"number\" id=\"b\" name=\"b\" value=\"50\"> = <output name=\"x\" for=\"a b\"></output> <br><br> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  HTML Form Elements Tag Description <form> Defines an HTML form for user input <input> Defines an input control <textarea> Defines a multiline input control (text area) <label> Defines a label for an <input> element <fieldset> Groups related elements in a form <legend> Defines a caption for a <fieldset> element <select> Defines a drop-down list <optgroup> Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list <option> Defines an option in a drop-down list <button> Defines a clickable button <datalist> Specifies a list of pre-defined options for input controls <output> Defines the result of a calculation For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

Example <img src=\"pic_trulli.jpg\" alt=\"Italian Trulli\"> Try it Yourself  Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" alt=\"Girl in a jacket\"> Try it Yourself  Example <img src=\"img_chania.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  HTML Images Syntax The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image. The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The <img> tag has two required attributes: src - Specifies the path to the image alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image Syntax <img src=\" url \" alt=\" alternatetext \"> The src Attribute The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image. Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image. Example <img src=\"img_chania.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  The alt Attribute The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). The value of the alt attribute should describe the image: Example <img src=\"img_chania.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute: Example <img src=\"wrongname.gif\" alt=\"Flowers in Chania\"> Try it Yourself  Tip: A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, and allows the user to \"listen\" to the content. Screen readers are useful for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled. Image Size - Width and Height You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image. Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" alt=\"Girl in a jacket\" style=\"width:500px;height:600px;\"> Try it Yourself  Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" alt=\"Girl in a jacket\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\"> Try it Yourself  The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels. Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the web page might flicker while the image loads. Width and Height, or Style? The width , height , and style attributes are all valid in HTML. However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> img { width: 100%; } </style> </head> <body> <img src=\"html5.gif\" alt=\"HTML5 Icon\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"> <img src=\"html5.gif\" alt=\"HTML5 Icon\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\"> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Images in Another Folder If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute: Example <img src=\"/images/html5.gif\" alt=\"HTML5 Icon\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\"> Try it Yourself  Images on Another Server/Website Some web sites point to an image on another server. To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute: Example <img src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg\" alt=\"W3Schools.com\"> Try it Yourself  Notes on external images: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; they can suddenly be removed or changed. Animated Images HTML allows animated GIFs: Example <img src=\"programming.gif\" alt=\"Computer Man\" style=\"width:48px;height:48px;\"> Try it Yourself  Image as a Link To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: Example <a href=\"default.asp\"> <img src=\"smiley.gif\" alt=\"HTML tutorial\" style=\"width:42px;height:42px;\"> </a> Try it Yourself  Image Floating Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text: Example <p><img src=\"smiley.gif\" alt=\"Smiley face\" style=\"float:right;width:42px;height:42px;\"> The image will float to the right of the text.</p> <p><img src=\"smiley.gif\" alt=\"Smiley face\" style=\"float:left;width:42px;height:42px;\"> The image will float to the left of the text.</p> Try it Yourself  Tip: To learn more about CSS Float, read our CSS Float Tutorial . Common Image Formats Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera): Abbreviation File Format File Extension APNG Animated Portable Network Graphics .apng GIF Graphics Interchange Format .gif ICO Microsoft Icon .ico, .cur JPEG Joint Photographic Expert Group image .jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp PNG Portable Network Graphics .png SVG Scalable Vector Graphics .svg Chapter Summary Use the HTML <img> element to define an image Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right Note: Loading large images takes time, and can slow down your web page.

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity). HSL Color Values In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form: hsl( hue , saturation , lightness ) Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white. Experiment by mixing the HSL values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(240, 100%, 50%) hsl(147, 50%, 47%) hsl(300, 76%, 72%) hsl(39, 100%, 50%) hsl(248, 53%, 58%) Try it Yourself  Saturation Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. 100% is pure color, no shades of gray. 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. 0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color. Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 80%, 50%) hsl(0, 60%, 50%) hsl(0, 40%, 50%) hsl(0, 20%, 50%) hsl(0, 0%, 50%) Try it Yourself  Lightness The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white). Example hsl(0, 100%, 0%) hsl(0, 100%, 25%) hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 100%, 75%) hsl(0, 100%, 90%) hsl(0, 100%, 100%) Try it Yourself  Shades of Gray Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades: Example hsl(0, 0%, 20%) hsl(0, 0%, 30%) hsl(0, 0%, 40%) hsl(0, 0%, 60%) hsl(0, 0%, 70%) hsl(0, 0%, 90%) Try it Yourself  HSLA Color Values HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla( hue, saturation , lightness, alpha ) The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all): Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% ALPHA 0.5 Example hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1) Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Example <b>This text is bold</b> Try it Yourself  The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. Example <strong>This text is important!</strong> Try it Yourself  HTML <i> and <em> Elements The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. Example <i>This text is italic</i> Try it Yourself  The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. Example <em>This text is emphasized</em> Try it Yourself  HTML <small> Element The HTML <small> element defines smaller text: Example <small>This is some smaller text.</small> Try it Yourself  HTML <mark> Element The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted: Example <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <del> Element The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text: Example <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <ins> Element The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text: Example <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <sub> Element The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H 2 O: Example <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p> Try it Yourself  HTML <sup> Element The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. CSS = Styles and Colors Manipulate Text Colors, Boxes What is CSS? Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more! Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to \"blue\", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)! Using CSS CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. Inline CSS An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element. The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red: Example <h1 style=\"color:blue;\">A Blue Heading</h1> <p style=\"color:red;\">A red paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  Internal CSS An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element. The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a \"powderblue\" background color: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> body {background-color: powderblue;} h1 {color: blue;} p {color: red;} </style> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  External CSS An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages. To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension. Here is what the \"styles.css\" file looks like: \"styles.css\": body { background-color: powderblue; } h1 { color: blue; } p { color: red; } Tip: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file! CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later. The CSS color property defines the text color to be used. The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used. The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used. Example Use of CSS color, font-family and font-size properties: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> h1 { color: blue; font-family: verdana; font-size: 300%; } p { color: red; font-family: courier; font-size: 160%; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  CSS Border The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element. Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements. Example Use of CSS border property: p { border: 2px solid powderblue; } Try it Yourself  CSS Padding The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border. Example Use of CSS border and padding properties: p { border: 2px solid powderblue; padding: 30px; } Try it Yourself  CSS Margin The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border. Example Use of CSS border and margin properties: p { border: 2px solid powderblue; margin: 50px; } Try it Yourself  Link to External CSS External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. Example This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css\"> Try it Yourself  Example This example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/html/styles.css\"> Try it Yourself  Example This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"> Try it Yourself  You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths . Chapter Summary Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements Use the CSS color property for text colors Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes Use the CSS border property for borders Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial .

Links allow users to click their way from page to page. HTML Links - Hyperlinks HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element! HTML Links - Syntax The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax: <a href=\" url \"> link text </a> The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address. Example This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\">Visit W3Schools.com!</a> Try it Yourself  By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue A visited link is underlined and purple An active link is underlined and red Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look! HTML Links - The target Attribute By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values: _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window Example Use target=\"_blank\" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit W3Schools!</a> Try it Yourself  Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute. A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the \"https://www\" part): Example <h2>Absolute URLs</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a></p> <h2>Relative URLs</h2> <p><a href=\"html_images.asp\">HTML Images</a></p> <p><a href=\"/css/default.asp\">CSS Tutorial</a></p> Try it Yourself  HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: Example <a href=\"default.asp\"> <img src=\"smiley.gif\" alt=\"HTML tutorial\" style=\"width:42px;height:42px;\"> </a> Try it Yourself  Link to an Email Address Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email): Example <a href=\"mailto:someone@example.com\">Send email</a> Try it Yourself  Button as a Link To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code. JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button: Example <button onclick=\"document.location='default.asp'\">HTML Tutorial</button> Try it Yourself  Tip: Learn more about JavaScript in our JavaScript Tutorial . Link Titles The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. Example <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\" title=\"Go to W3Schools HTML section\">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a> Try it Yourself  More on Absolute URLs and Relative URLs Example Use a full URL to link to a web page: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp\">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself  Example Link to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: <a href=\"/html/default.asp\">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself  Example Link to a page located in the same folder as the current page: <a href=\"default.asp\">HTML tutorial</a> Try it Yourself  You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths .

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page. The graphic to the left is created with <canvas> . It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text. What is HTML Canvas? The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images. Canvas is supported by all major browsers. Canvas Examples A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content. The markup looks like this: <canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\"></canvas> Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute. Here is an example of a basic, empty canvas: Your browser does not support the canvas element. Example <canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\" style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\"> </canvas> Try it Yourself  Add a JavaScript After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing. Here are some examples: Draw a Line Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); ctx.moveTo(0, 0); ctx.lineTo(200, 100); ctx.stroke(); </script> Try it Yourself  Draw a Circle Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); ctx.beginPath(); ctx.arc(95, 50, 40, 0, 2 * Math.PI); ctx.stroke(); </script> Try it Yourself  Draw a Text Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); ctx.font = \"30px Arial\"; ctx.fillText(\"Hello World\", 10, 50); </script> Try it Yourself  Stroke Text Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); ctx.font = \"30px Arial\"; ctx.strokeText(\"Hello World\", 10, 50); </script> Try it Yourself  Draw Linear Gradient Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); // Create gradient var grd = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 200, 0); grd.addColorStop(0, \"red\"); grd.addColorStop(1, \"white\"); // Fill with gradient ctx.fillStyle = grd; ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80); </script> Try it Yourself  Draw Circular Gradient Your browser does not support the canvas element Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); // Create gradient var grd = ctx.createRadialGradient(75, 50, 5, 90, 60, 100); grd.addColorStop(0, \"red\"); grd.addColorStop(1, \"white\"); // Fill with gradient ctx.fillStyle = grd; ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80); </script> Try it Yourself  Draw Image Example <script> var c = document.getElementById(\"myCanvas\"); var ctx = c.getContext(\"2d\"); var img = document.getElementById(\"scream\"); ctx.drawImage(img, 10, 10); </script> Try it Yourself  HTML Canvas Tutorial To learn more about <canvas> , please read our HTML Canvas Tutorial .

An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity). RGB Color Values In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb( red, green , blue ) Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255. This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors! For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0. Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0. To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0). To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255). Example rgb(255, 0, 0) rgb(0, 0, 255) rgb(60, 179, 113) rgb(238, 130, 238) rgb(255, 165, 0) rgb(106, 90, 205) Try it Yourself  Experiment by mixing the RGB values below: RED 255 GREEN 0 BLUE 0 Shades of Gray Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters: Example rgb(60, 60, 60) rgb(100, 100, 100) rgb(140, 140, 140) rgb(180, 180, 180) rgb(200, 200, 200) rgb(240, 240, 240) Try it Yourself  RGBA Color Values RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba( red, green , blue, alpha ) The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all): Example rgba(255, 99, 71, 0) rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2) rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.4) rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.6) rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.8) rgba(255, 99, 71, 1) Try it Yourself  Experiment by mixing the RGBA values below: RED 255 GREEN 0 BLUE 0 ALPHA 0  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

The HTML <picture> Element The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device. Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable. Example Show different images for different screen sizes: <picture> <source media=\"(min-width: 650px)\" srcset=\"img_food.jpg\"> <source media=\"(min-width: 465px)\" srcset=\"img_car.jpg\"> <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\"> </picture> Try it Yourself  Note: Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> tags match. When to use the Picture Element There are two main purposes for the <picture> element: 1. Bandwidth If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements. 2. Format Support Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements. Example The browser will use the first image format it recognizes: <picture> <source srcset=\"img_avatar.png\"> <source srcset=\"img_girl.jpg\"> <img src=\"img_beatles.gif\" alt=\"Beatles\" style=\"width:auto;\"> </picture> Try it Yourself  Note: The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> elements.

What is a Web Worker? When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished. A web worker is an external JavaScript file that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. Web workers are useful for heavy code that can't be run on the main thread, without causing long tasks that make the page unresponsive. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support the Web Workers API. API Web Workers 4.0 10.0 3.5 4.0 11.5 Web Workers API Example The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background: Example Count numbers: Start Worker Stop Worker Try it Yourself  Note: Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks! Check Web Worker API Support Before using web worker, we can quickly check browser support: Example Test browser support: <script> const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if(typeof(Worker) !== \"undefined\") { x.innerHTML = \"Your browser support Web Workers!\"; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers.\"; } </script> Try it Yourself  Create a .js Web Worker File Now, let's create a web worker in an external JavaScript file. Here we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the \"demo_workers.js\" file: var i = 0; function timedCount() { i = i + 1; postMessage(i); setTimeout(\"timedCount()\",500); } timedCount(); Note: The important part of the code above is the postMessage() method - which is used to post messages back to the HTML page. Create a Web Worker Object Once we have created the .js web worker file, we can call it from an HTML page. The following lines checks if a worker (w) already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and points to the .js file: \"demo_workers.js\": if (typeof(w) == \"undefined\") { w = new Worker(\"demo_workers.js\"); } Then we can SEND and RETRIEVE messages from the web worker. Data is sent between web workers and the main thread via a system of messages - both sides send their messages using the postMessage() method, and respond to messages via the onmessage event handler. Add an onmessage event listener to the web worker object. w.onmessage = function(event){ document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = event.data; }; When the web worker in the .js posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data from the web worker is stored in event.data . Terminate a Web Worker When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages until it is terminated. To terminate a web worker object, and free browser/computer resources, use the terminate() method: w.terminate(); Reuse the Web Worker If you set the web worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, you can reuse the worker/code: w = undefined; Full Web Worker Example We have already seen the Web Worker code in the .js file. Below is the full code for the HTML page: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <p>Count numbers: <output id=\"result\"></output></p> <button onclick=\"startWorker()\">Start Worker</button> <button onclick=\"stopWorker()\">Stop Worker</button> <script> let w; function startWorker() { const x = document.getElementById(\"result\"); if (typeof(Worker) !== \"undefined\") { if (typeof(w) == \"undefined\") { w = new Worker(\"demo_workers.js\"); } w.onmessage = function(event) { x.innerHTML = event.data; }; } else { x.innerHTML = \"Sorry! No Web Worker support.\"; } } function stopWorker() { w.terminate(); w = undefined; } </script> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Web Workers and the DOM Since web workers are in external .js files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects: The window object The document object The parent object  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

SVG graphics are scalable, and do not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized: ĀĀĀĀĀ ĀĀĀĀĀ SVG Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. SVG is supported by all major browsers. What is SVG? SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web SVG defines graphics in XML format Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated SVG is a W3C recommendation SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM, XSL and JavaScript The <svg> Element The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for drawing paths, rectangles, circles, polygons, text, and much more. SVG Circle Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\"> <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"green\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"yellow\" /> </svg> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  SVG Rectangle Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. Example <svg width=\"400\" height=\"120\"> <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"red\" stroke-width=\"6\" fill=\"blue\" /> </svg> Try it Yourself  SVG Rectangle with Opacity and Rounded Corners Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. Example <svg width=\"400\" height=\"180\"> <rect x=\"50\" y=\"20\" rx=\"20\" ry=\"20\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" style=\"fill:red;stroke:black;stroke-width:5;opacity:0.5\" /> </svg> Try it Yourself  SVG Star Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers to SVG graphics. In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape. Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic. Comparison of SVG and Canvas The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG: SVG Canvas Resolution independent Support for event handlers Good text rendering capabilities Slow rendering if complex Not suited for game applications Resolution dependent No support for event handlers Poor text rendering capabilities You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg Well suited for graphic-intensive games SVG Tutorial To learn more about SVG, please read our SVG Tutorial .

Create a Bookmark in HTML Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long. To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it. When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark. Example First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark: <h2 id=\"C4\">Chapter 4</h2> Then, add a link to the bookmark (\"Jump to Chapter 4\"), from within the same page: Example <a href=\"#C4\">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Try it Yourself  You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page: <a href=\"html_demo.html#C4\">Jump to Chapter 4</a> Chapter Summary Use the id attribute (id=\" value \") to define bookmarks in a page Use the href attribute (href=\"# value \") to link to the bookmark HTML Link Tags Tag Description <a> Defines a hyperlink For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

HEX Color Values In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: # rrggbb Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255). For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00. Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00. To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000. To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff. Experiment by mixing the HEX values below: RED ff GREEN 0 BLUE 0 Example #ff0000 #0000ff #3cb371 #ee82ee #ffa500 #6a5acd Try it Yourself  Shades of Gray Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters: Example #404040 #686868 #a0a0a0 #bebebe #dcdcdc #f8f8f8 Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

HTML Input Types Here are the different input types you can use in HTML: <input type=\"button\"> <input type=\"checkbox\"> <input type=\"color\"> <input type=\"date\"> <input type=\"datetime-local\"> <input type=\"email\"> <input type=\"file\"> <input type=\"hidden\"> <input type=\"image\"> <input type=\"month\"> <input type=\"number\"> <input type=\"password\"> <input type=\"radio\"> <input type=\"range\"> <input type=\"reset\"> <input type=\"search\"> <input type=\"submit\"> <input type=\"tel\"> <input type=\"text\"> <input type=\"time\"> <input type=\"url\"> <input type=\"week\"> Tip: The default value of the type attribute is \"text\". Input Type Text <input type=\"text\"> defines a single-line text input field : Example <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: First name: Last name: Input Type Password <input type=\"password\"> defines a password field : Example <form> <label for=\"username\">Username:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\"><br> <label for=\"pwd\">Password:</label><br> <input type=\"password\" id=\"pwd\" name=\"pwd\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: Username: Password: The characters in a password field are masked (shown as asterisks or circles). Input Type Submit <input type=\"submit\"> defines a button for submitting form data to a form-handler . The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data. The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute: Example <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: First name: Last name: If you omit the submit button's value attribute, the button will get a default text: Example <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Reset <input type=\"reset\"> defines a reset button that will reset all form values to their default values: Example <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\"> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: First name: Last name: If you change the input values and then click the \"Reset\" button, the form-data will be reset to the default values. Input Type Radio <input type=\"radio\"> defines a radio button . Radio buttons let a user select ONLY ONE of a limited number of choices: Example <p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p> <form> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"html\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"HTML\"> <label for=\"html\">HTML</label><br> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"css\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"CSS\"> <label for=\"css\">CSS</label><br> <input type=\"radio\" id=\"javascript\" name=\"fav_language\" value=\"JavaScript\"> <label for=\"javascript\">JavaScript</label> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: HTML CSS JavaScript Input Type Checkbox <input type=\"checkbox\"> defines a checkbox . Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices. Example <form> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle1\" name=\"vehicle1\" value=\"Bike\"> <label for=\"vehicle1\"> I have a bike</label><br> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle2\" name=\"vehicle2\" value=\"Car\"> <label for=\"vehicle2\"> I have a car</label><br> <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"vehicle3\" name=\"vehicle3\" value=\"Boat\"> <label for=\"vehicle3\"> I have a boat</label> </form> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: I have a bike I have a car I have a boat Input Type Button <input type=\"button\"> defines a button : Example <input type=\"button\" onclick=\"alert('Hello World!')\" value=\"Click Me!\"> Try it Yourself  This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser: Input Type Color The <input type=\"color\"> is used for input fields that should contain a color. Depending on browser support, a color picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"favcolor\">Select your favorite color:</label> <input type=\"color\" id=\"favcolor\" name=\"favcolor\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Date The <input type=\"date\"> is used for input fields that should contain a date. Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"birthday\">Birthday:</label> <input type=\"date\" id=\"birthday\" name=\"birthday\"> </form> Try it Yourself  You can also use the min and max attributes to add restrictions to dates: Example <form> <label for=\"datemax\">Enter a date before 1980-01-01:</label> <input type=\"date\" id=\"datemax\" name=\"datemax\" max=\"1979-12-31\"><br><br> <label for=\"datemin\">Enter a date after 2000-01-01:</label> <input type=\"date\" id=\"datemin\" name=\"datemin\" min=\"2000-01-02\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Datetime-local The <input type=\"datetime-local\"> specifies a date and time input field, with no time zone. Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"birthdaytime\">Birthday (date and time):</label> <input type=\"datetime-local\" id=\"birthdaytime\" name=\"birthdaytime\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Email The <input type=\"email\"> is used for input fields that should contain an e-mail address. Depending on browser support, the e-mail address can be automatically validated when submitted. Some smartphones recognize the email type, and add \".com\" to the keyboard to match email input. Example <form> <label for=\"email\">Enter your email:</label> <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Image The <input type=\"image\"> defines an image as a submit button. The path to the image is specified in the src attribute. Example <form> <input type=\"image\" src=\"img_submit.gif\" alt=\"Submit\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type File The <input type=\"file\"> defines a file-select field and a \"Browse\" button for file uploads. Example <form> <label for=\"myfile\">Select a file:</label> <input type=\"file\" id=\"myfile\" name=\"myfile\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Hidden The <input type=\"hidden\"> defines a hidden input field (not visible to a user). A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted. Note: While the value is not displayed to the user in the page's content, it is visible (and can be edited) using any browser's developer tools or \"View Source\" functionality. Do not use hidden inputs as a form of security! Example <form> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\"><br><br> <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"custId\" name=\"custId\" value=\"3487\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Month The <input type=\"month\"> allows the user to select a month and year. Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"bdaymonth\">Birthday (month and year):</label> <input type=\"month\" id=\"bdaymonth\" name=\"bdaymonth\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Number The <input type=\"number\"> defines a numeric input field. You can also set restrictions on what numbers are accepted. The following example displays a numeric input field, where you can enter a value from 1 to 5: Example <form> <label for=\"quantity\">Quantity (between 1 and 5):</label> <input type=\"number\" id=\"quantity\" name=\"quantity\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Restrictions Here is a list of some common input restrictions: Attribute Description checked Specifies that an input field should be pre-selected when the page loads (for type=\"checkbox\" or type=\"radio\") disabled Specifies that an input field should be disabled max Specifies the maximum value for an input field maxlength Specifies the maximum number of character for an input field min Specifies the minimum value for an input field pattern Specifies a regular expression to check the input value against readonly Specifies that an input field is read only (cannot be changed) required Specifies that an input field is required (must be filled out) size Specifies the width (in characters) of an input field step Specifies the legal number intervals for an input field value Specifies the default value for an input field You will learn more about input restrictions in the next chapter. The following example displays a numeric input field, where you can enter a value from 0 to 100, in steps of 10. The default value is 30: Example <form> <label for=\"quantity\">Quantity:</label> <input type=\"number\" id=\"quantity\" name=\"quantity\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" step=\"10\" value=\"30\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Range The <input type=\"range\"> defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the min , max , and step attributes: Example <form> <label for=\"vol\">Volume (between 0 and 50):</label> <input type=\"range\" id=\"vol\" name=\"vol\" min=\"0\" max=\"50\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Search The <input type=\"search\"> is used for search fields (a search field behaves like a regular text field). Example <form> <label for=\"gsearch\">Search Google:</label> <input type=\"search\" id=\"gsearch\" name=\"gsearch\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Tel The <input type=\"tel\"> is used for input fields that should contain a telephone number. Example <form> <label for=\"phone\">Enter your phone number:</label> <input type=\"tel\" id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" pattern=\"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Time The <input type=\"time\"> allows the user to select a time (no time zone). Depending on browser support, a time picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"appt\">Select a time:</label> <input type=\"time\" id=\"appt\" name=\"appt\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Url The <input type=\"url\"> is used for input fields that should contain a URL address. Depending on browser support, the url field can be automatically validated when submitted. Some smartphones recognize the url type, and adds \".com\" to the keyboard to match url input. Example <form> <label for=\"homepage\">Add your homepage:</label> <input type=\"url\" id=\"homepage\" name=\"homepage\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Input Type Week The <input type=\"week\"> allows the user to select a week and year. Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field. Example <form> <label for=\"week\">Select a week:</label> <input type=\"week\" id=\"week\" name=\"week\"> </form> Try it Yourself  HTML Input Type Attribute Tag Description <input type=\"\"> Specifies the input type to display  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Background Image on an HTML element To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property: Example Add a background image on a <p> element: <p style=\"background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');\"> Try it Yourself  You can also specify the background image in the <style> element, in the <head> section: Example Specify the background image in the <style> element: <style> p { background-image: url('img_girl.jpg'); } </style> Try it Yourself  Background Image on a Page If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element: Example Add a background image for the entire page: <style> body { background-image: url('img_girl.jpg'); } </style> Try it Yourself  Background Repeat If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element: Example <style> body { background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg'); } </style> Try it Yourself  To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat . Example <style> body { background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg'); background-repeat: no-repeat; } </style> Try it Yourself  Background Cover If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover. Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed: This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions): Example <style> body { background-image: url('img_girl.jpg'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-attachment: fixed; background-size: cover; } </style> Try it Yourself  Background Stretch If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100% : Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element. Example <style> body { background-image: url('img_girl.jpg'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-attachment: fixed; background-size: 100% 100%; } </style> Try it Yourself  Learn More CSS From the examples above you have learned that background images can be styled by using the CSS background properties.

What are Semantic Elements? A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <img> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content. Semantic Elements in HTML Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id=\"nav\"> <div class=\"header\"> <div id=\"footer\"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer. In HTML there are several semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page: <article> <aside> <details> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <header> <main> <mark> <nav> <section> <summary> <time> HTML <section> Element The <section> element defines a section in a document. According to W3C's HTML documentation: \"A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.\" Examples of where a <section> element can be used: Chapters Introduction News items Contact information A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information. Example Two sections in a document: <section> <h1>WWF</h1> <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p> </section> <section> <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1> <p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p> </section> Try it Yourself  HTML <article> Element The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site. Examples of where the <article> element can be used: Forum posts Blog posts User comments Product cards Newspaper articles Example Three articles with independent, self-contained content: <article> <h2>Google Chrome</h2> <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p> </article> <article> <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2> <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p> </article> <article> <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2> <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p> </article> Try it Yourself  Example 2 Use CSS to style the <article> element: <html> <head> <style> .all-browsers { margin: 0; padding: 5px; background-color: lightgray; } .all-browsers > h1, .browser { margin: 10px; padding: 5px; } .browser { background: white; } .browser > h2, p { margin: 4px; font-size: 90%; } </style> </head> <body> <article class=\"all-browsers\"> <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1> <article class=\"browser\"> <h2>Google Chrome</h2> <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p> </article> <article class=\"browser\"> <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2> <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p> </article> <article class=\"browser\"> <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2> <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p> </article> </article> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa? The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. The <section> element defines section in a document. Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot! So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements. HTML <header> Element The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. A <header> element typically contains: one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>) logo or icon authorship information Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer> , <address> or another <header> element. Example A header for an <article>: <article> <header> <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1> <p>WWF's mission:</p> </header> <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p> </article> Try it Yourself  HTML <footer> Element The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section. A <footer> element typically contains: authorship information copyright information contact information sitemap back to top links related documents You can have several <footer> elements in one document. Example A footer section in a document: <footer> <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hege@example.com\">hege@example.com</a></p> </footer> Try it Yourself  HTML <nav> Element The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links. Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content. Example A set of navigation links: <nav> <a href=\"/html/\">HTML</a> | <a href=\"/css/\">CSS</a> | <a href=\"/js/\">JavaScript</a> | <a href=\"/jquery/\">jQuery</a> </nav> Try it Yourself  HTML <aside> Element The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar). The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content. Example Display some content aside from the content it is placed in: <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p> <aside> <h4>Epcot Center</h4> <p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p> </aside> Try it Yourself  Example 2 Use CSS to style the <aside> element: <html> <head> <style> aside { width: 30%; padding-left: 15px; margin-left: 15px; float: right; font-style: italic; background-color: lightgray; } </style> </head> <body> <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p> <aside> <p>The Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p> </aside> <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p> <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element. The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration. Example <figure> <img src=\"pic_trulli.jpg\" alt=\"Trulli\"> <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption> </figure> Try it Yourself  Why Semantic Elements? According to the W3C: \"A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities.\" Semantic Elements in HTML Below is a list of some of the semantic elements in HTML. Tag Description <article> Defines independent, self-contained content <aside> Defines content aside from the page content <details> Defines additional details that the user can view or hide <figcaption> Defines a caption for a <figure> element <figure> Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. <footer> Defines a footer for a document or section <header> Specifies a header for a document or section <main> Specifies the main content of a document <mark> Defines marked/highlighted text <nav> Defines navigation links <section> Defines a section in a document <summary> Defines a visible heading for a <details> element <time> Defines a date/time For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

Previous Next  HTML Summary This tutorial has taught you how to use HTML to create your own web site. HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display. For more information on HTML, please take a look at our HTML examples and our HTML reference . You can also test your HTML skills with HTML Exercises and HTML Quizzes . Now You Know HTML, What's Next? Learn CSS CSS lets you style your HTML pages. CSS gives you total control of the layout, without messing up the document content. To learn more about CSS, please visit our CSS tutorial . Learn JavaScript JavaScript makes your website more dynamic. A dynamic website can react to events and allow user interaction. JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the internet and it works with all major browsers. If you want to learn more about JavaScript, please visit our JavaScript tutorial . Publishing Your Website To make your website available to the world, you must publish it. For this, you have two options: Use an Internet Service Provider Host your own website Using an Internet Service Provider An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, and colocation. Using an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the most common option. Advantages: Connection Speed - ISPs have very fast connections to the internet. Powerful Hardware - ISPs have powerful web servers that can be shared by several clients. You can also expect an effective load balancing and necessary backup servers Security and Stability - ISPs are specialists on web hosting. Expect more than 99% up time, the latest software patches, and the best virus protection Things to Consider: 24-hour support - The ISP should offer 24-hours support. Toll-free phone could also be vital Daily Backup - The ISP must run a daily backup routine Traffic Volume - Check the ISP's traffic volume restrictions (do not end up paying a fortune for unexpected high traffic) Bandwidth or Content Restrictions - Check the ISP's bandwidth and content restrictions (Is it possible to publish pictures, video, or sound?) E-mail Capabilities - Make sure the ISP supports the e-mail capabilities you need Database Access - Make sure the ISP supports the database access you need Hosting Your Own Website Hosting your own website, on your own server, is also an option. Things to Consider: Hardware Expenses - To run a \"real\" web site, you must buy powerful server hardware (a low cost PC will not do the job). You will also need a permanent (24/7) high-speed connection Software Expenses - Server-licenses are often higher than client-licenses. Server-licenses also might have limits on number of users Labor Expenses - Don't expect low labor expenses. You have to install your own hardware and software. You also have to deal with bugs and viruses, and keep your server constantly running Kickstart your career Get certified by completing the course Get certified w 3 s c h o o l s C E R T I F I E D . 2 0 2 5  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

Unordered HTML List An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default: Example <ul> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea</li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  Unordered HTML List - Choose List Item Marker The CSS list-style-type property is used to define the style of the list item marker. It can have one of the following values: Value Description disc Sets the list item marker to a bullet (default) circle Sets the list item marker to a circle square Sets the list item marker to a square none The list items will not be marked Disc Example - Disc <ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea</li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  Circle Example - Circle <ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea</li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  Square Example - Square <ul style=\"list-style-type:square;\"> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea</li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  No List Marker Example - None <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea</li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  Nested HTML Lists Lists can be nested (list inside list): Example <ul> <li>Coffee</li> <li>Tea <ul> <li>Black tea</li> <li>Green tea</li> </ul> </li> <li>Milk</li> </ul> Try it Yourself  Note: A list item ( <li> ) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc. Horizontal List with CSS HTML lists can be styled in many different ways with CSS. One popular way is to style a list horizontally, to create a navigation menu: Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> ul { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow: hidden; background-color: #333333; } li { float: left; } li a { display: block; color: white; text-align: center; padding: 16px; text-decoration: none; } li a:hover { background-color: #111111; } </style> </head> <body> <ul> <li><a href=\"#home\">Home</a></li> <li><a href=\"#news\">News</a></li> <li><a href=\"#contact\">Contact</a></li> <li><a href=\"#about\">About</a></li> </ul> </body> </html> Try it Yourself  Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial . Chapter Summary Use the HTML <ul> element to define an unordered list Use the CSS list-style-type property to define the list item marker Use the HTML <li> element to define a list item Lists can be nested List items can contain other HTML elements Use the CSS property float:left to display a list horizontally HTML List Tags Tag Description <ul> Defines an unordered list <ol> Defines an ordered list <li> Defines a list item <dl> Defines a description list <dt> Defines a term in a description list <dd> Describes the term in a description list For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

File Path Examples Path Description <img src=\"picture.jpg\"> The \"picture.jpg\" file is located in the same folder as the current page <img src=\"images/picture.jpg\"> The \"picture.jpg\" file is located in the images folder in the current folder <img src=\"/images/picture.jpg\"> The \"picture.jpg\" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web <img src=\"../picture.jpg\"> The \"picture.jpg\" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder HTML File Paths A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure. File paths are used when linking to external files, like: Web pages Images Style sheets JavaScripts Absolute File Paths An absolute file path is the full URL to a file: Example <img src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain\"> Try it Yourself  The <img> tag is explained in the chapter: HTML Images . Relative File Paths A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web: Example <img src=\"/images/picture.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain\"> Try it Yourself  In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder: Example <img src=\"images/picture.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain\"> Try it Yourself  In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder: Example <img src=\"../images/picture.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain\"> Try it Yourself  Best Practice It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible). When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!

HTML Attributes All HTML elements can have attributes Attributes provide additional information about elements Attributes are always specified in the start tag Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name=\"value\" The href Attribute The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: Example <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com\">Visit W3Schools</a> Try it Yourself  You will learn more about links in our HTML Links chapter . The src Attribute The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\"> Try it Yourself  There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute: 1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg\" . Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed. 2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src=\"img_girl.jpg\". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src=\"/images/img_girl.jpg\". Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. The width and height Attributes The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels): Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\"> Try it Yourself  The alt Attribute The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" alt=\"Girl with a jacket\"> Try it Yourself  Example See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist: <img src=\"img_typo.jpg\" alt=\"Girl with a jacket\"> Try it Yourself  You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter . The style Attribute The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. Example <p style=\"color:red;\">This is a red paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter . The lang Attribute You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. The following example specifies English as the language: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> ... </body> </html> Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country. The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en-US\"> <body> ... </body> </html> You can see all the language codes in our HTML Language Code Reference . The title Attribute The title attribute defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element: Example <p title=\"I'm a tooltip\">This is a paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names. The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE . However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML. At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names. We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values. However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML. Good: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Bad: <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space: Example <p title=Description of W3Schools> Try it Yourself  At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values. Single or Double Quotes? Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used. In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: <p title='John \"ShotGun\" Nelson'> Or vice versa: <p title=\"John 'ShotGun' Nelson\"> Try it Yourself  Chapter Summary All HTML elements can have attributes The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page The title attribute defines some extra information about an element HTML Attribute Reference A complete list of all attributes for each HTML element, is listed in our: HTML Attribute Reference .

Example My First JavaScript Click me to display Date and Time Try it Yourself  The HTML <script> Tag The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript). The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute. Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content. To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method. This JavaScript example writes \"Hello JavaScript!\" into an HTML element with id=\"demo\": Example <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; </script> Try it Yourself  Tip: You can learn much more about JavaScript in our JavaScript Tutorial . A Taste of JavaScript Here are some examples of what JavaScript can do: Example JavaScript can change content: document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; Try it Yourself  Example JavaScript can change styles: document.getElementById(\"demo\").style.fontSize = \"25px\"; document.getElementById(\"demo\").style.color = \"red\"; document.getElementById(\"demo\").style.backgroundColor = \"yellow\"; Try it Yourself  Example JavaScript can change attributes: document.getElementById(\"image\").src = \"picture.gif\"; Try it Yourself  The HTML <noscript> Tag The HTML <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts: Example <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\"; </script> <noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript> Try it Yourself  HTML Script Tags Tag Description <script> Defines a client-side script <noscript> Defines an alternate content for users that do not support client-side scripts For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference .

Previous Next  A Web API is a developer's dream. It can extend the functionality of the browser It can greatly simplify complex functions It can provide easy syntax to complex code What is Web API? API stands for A pplication P rogramming I nterface. An API is some kind of interface that includes a set of functions and subroutines that allow programmers to access specific features or data of an application, operating system or other services. A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web. HTML APIs All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, and to help accessing data. Here are some of the main HTML5 APIs: 1. Geolocation API - This API is used to access the current location of a user (with latitude and longitude). 2. Drag and Drop API - This API enables you to use drag-and-drop features in browsers. 3. Web Storage API - This API has mechanisms to let browsers store key/value pairs (in a more intuitive way than cookies). 4. Web Workers API - This API allows a JavaScript to run in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. Users can continue to do whatever they want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background. 5. Server-Sent Events API - This API allows a web page to automatically get updates from a server. 6. Canvas API - This API lets you draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. Notes on Using HTML APIs When implementing an HTML API, you should always: Check Browser Capability - Always check that the target browsers support the API. Always add script or message to be run if a browser does not support it. Add Robust Error Handling - Add robust error handling to take care of scenarios where an API may not function as expected, to ensure a seamless user experience. Request User Permission - When using an API that accesses sensitive data, like the Geolocation API (which will access the user's geographical position), always prompt the user for consent before proceeding. Third Party APIs Third party APIs are not built into your browser. To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web. Examples: YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site. Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site. Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.

Video Example Courtesy of Big Buck Bunny : Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Try it Yourself  The HTML <video> Element To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element: Example <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls> <source src=\"movie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"> <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> Try it Yourself  How it Works The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume. It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads. The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format. The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element. HTML <video> Autoplay To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute: Example <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" autoplay> <source src=\"movie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"> <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> Try it Yourself  Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed. Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted): Example <video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" autoplay muted> <source src=\"movie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"> <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> Try it Yourself  Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the <video> element. Element <video> 4.0 9.0 3.5 4.0 10.5 HTML Video Formats There are three supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg. The browser support for the different formats is: Browser MP4 WebM Ogg Edge YES YES YES Chrome YES YES YES Firefox YES YES YES Safari YES YES NO Opera YES YES YES HTML Video - Media Types File Format Media Type MP4 video/mp4 WebM video/webm Ogg video/ogg HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events The HTML DOM defines methods, properties, and events for the <video> element. This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume. There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc. Example: Using JavaScript Play/Pause Big Small Normal Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Video courtesy of Big Buck Bunny . Try it Yourself  For a full DOM reference, go to our HTML Audio/Video DOM Reference .

What is XHTML? XHTML stands for E X tensible H yper T ext M arkup L anguage XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application XHTML is supported by all major browsers Why XHTML? XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be \"well-formed\"). XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling. If you want to study XML, please read our XML Tutorial . The Most Important Differences from HTML <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory Elements must always be properly nested Elements must always be closed Elements must always be in lowercase Attribute names must always be in lowercase Attribute values must always be quoted Attribute minimization is forbidden XHTML - <!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory An XHTML document must have an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document. Example Here is an XHTML document with a minimum of required tags: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd\"> <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> <head> <title>Title of document</title> </head> <body> some content here... </body> </html> XHTML Elements Must be Properly Nested In XHTML, elements must always be properly nested within each other, like this: Correct: <b><i>Some text</i></b> Wrong: <b><i>Some text</b></i> XHTML Elements Must Always be Closed In XHTML, elements must always be closed, like this: Correct: <p>This is a paragraph</p> <p>This is another paragraph</p> Wrong: <p>This is a paragraph <p>This is another paragraph XHTML Empty Elements Must Always be Closed In XHTML, empty elements must always be closed, like this: Correct: A break: <br /> A horizontal rule: <hr /> An image: <img src=\"happy.gif\" alt=\"Happy face\" /> Wrong: A break: <br> A horizontal rule: <hr> An image: <img src=\"happy.gif\" alt=\"Happy face\"> XHTML Elements Must be in Lowercase In XHTML, element names must always be in lowercase, like this: Correct: <body> <p>This is a paragraph</p> </body> Wrong: <BODY> <P>This is a paragraph</P> </BODY> XHTML Attribute Names Must be in Lowercase In XHTML, attribute names must always be in lowercase, like this: Correct: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Wrong: <a HREF=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> XHTML Attribute Values Must be Quoted In XHTML, attribute values must always be quoted, like this: Correct: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/\">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> Wrong: <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a> XHTML Attribute Minimization is Forbidden In XHTML, attribute minimization is forbidden: Correct: <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"vehicle\" value=\"car\" checked=\"checked\" /> <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" disabled=\"disabled\" /> Wrong: <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"vehicle\" value=\"car\" checked /> <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" disabled /> Validate HTML With The W3C Validator Put your web address in the box below:  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!
