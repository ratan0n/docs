The <div> Element The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after. Example A <div> element takes up all available width: Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet. Result Lorem Ipsum I am a div dolor sit amet. Try it Yourself  The <div> element has no required attributes, but style , class and id are common. <div> as a container The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together. Example A <div> element with HTML elements: <div> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England.</p> <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Center align a <div> element If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto . Example <style> div { width:300px; margin:auto; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Multiple <div> elements You can have many <div> containers on the same page. Example <div> <h2>London</h2> <p>London is the capital city of England.</p> <p>London has over 9 million inhabitants.</p> </div> <div> <h2>Oslo</h2> <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p> <p>Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants.</p> </div> <div> <h2>Rome</h2> <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p> <p>Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Aligning <div> elements side by side When building web pages, you often want to have two or more <div> elements side by side, like this: London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. There are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all include some CSS styling. We will look at the most common methods: Float The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years. The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. Example How to use float to align div elements side by side: <style> .mycontainer { width:100%; overflow:auto; } .mycontainer div { width:33%; float:left; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.

Inline-block If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block , the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other. Example How to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side: <style> div { width: 30%; display: inline-block; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants. Try it Yourself  Flex The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container. Example How to use flex to align div elements side by side: <style> .mycontainer { display: flex; } .mycontainer > div { width:33%; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.

Grid The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually. The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column. Example How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side: <style> .grid-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%; } </style> Result London London is the capital city of England. London has over 9 million inhabitants. Oslo Oslo is the capital city of Norway. Oslo has over 700,000 inhabitants. Rome Rome is the capital city of Italy. Rome has over 4 million inhabitants.
