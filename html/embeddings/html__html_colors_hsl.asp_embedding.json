HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity). HSL Color Values In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form: hsl( hue , saturation , lightness ) Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white. Experiment by mixing the HSL values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(240, 100%, 50%) hsl(147, 50%, 47%) hsl(300, 76%, 72%) hsl(39, 100%, 50%) hsl(248, 53%, 58%) Try it Yourself  Saturation Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. 100% is pure color, no shades of gray. 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. 0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color. Example hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 80%, 50%) hsl(0, 60%, 50%) hsl(0, 40%, 50%) hsl(0, 20%, 50%) hsl(0, 0%, 50%) Try it Yourself  Lightness The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white). Example hsl(0, 100%, 0%) hsl(0, 100%, 25%) hsl(0, 100%, 50%) hsl(0, 100%, 75%) hsl(0, 100%, 90%) hsl(0, 100%, 100%) Try it Yourself  Shades of Gray Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades: Example hsl(0, 0%, 20%) hsl(0, 0%, 30%) hsl(0, 0%, 40%) hsl(0, 0%, 60%) hsl(0, 0%, 70%) hsl(0, 0%, 90%) Try it Yourself  HSLA Color Values HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla( hue, saturation , lightness, alpha ) The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all): Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below: HUE 0 SATURATION 100% LIGHTNESS 50% ALPHA 0.5 Example hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.4) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.6) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.8) hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1) Try it Yourself   Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!
