The Action Attribute The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called \"action_page.php\". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data: Example On submit, send form data to \"action_page.php\": <form action=\"/action_page.php\"> <label for=\"fname\">First name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"fname\" name=\"fname\" value=\"John\"><br> <label for=\"lname\">Last name:</label><br> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lname\" name=\"lname\" value=\"Doe\"><br><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> </form> Try it Yourself  Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page. The Target Attribute The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. The target attribute can have one of the following values: Value Description _blank The response is displayed in a new window or tab _self The response is displayed in the current window _parent The response is displayed in the parent frame _top The response is displayed in the full body of the window framename The response is displayed in a named iframe The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window. Example Here, the submitted result will open in a new browser tab: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" target=\"_blank\"> Try it Yourself  The Method Attribute The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method=\"get\" ) or as HTTP post transaction (with method=\"post\" ). The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. Example This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" method=\"get\"> Try it Yourself  Example This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" method=\"post\"> Try it Yourself  Notes on GET: Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!) The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters) Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google Notes on POST: Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL) POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data. Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information! The Autocomplete Attribute The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off. When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. Example A form with autocomplete on: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" autocomplete=\"on\"> Try it Yourself  The Novalidate Attribute The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. Example A form with a novalidate attribute: <form action=\"/action_page.php\" novalidate> Try it Yourself  List of All <form> Attributes Attribute Description accept-charset Specifies the character encodings used for form submission action Specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted autocomplete Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off enctype Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server (only for method=\"post\") method Specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data name Specifies the name of the form novalidate Specifies that the form should not be validated when submitted rel Specifies the relationship between a linked resource and the current document target Specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!
