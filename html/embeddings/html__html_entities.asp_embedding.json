If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags. Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters. Entity names look like this: & entity_name ; Entity numbers look like this: &# entity_number ; To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers. Non-breaking Space A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp; A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line. Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. Examples:  10 10 km/h 10 PM Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity. The non-breaking hyphen ( &#8209; ) is used to define a hyphen character () that does not break into a new line.

Combining Diacritical Marks A diacritical mark is a \"glyph\" added to a letter. Some diacritical marks, like grave ( ) and acute ( ) are called accents. Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.
