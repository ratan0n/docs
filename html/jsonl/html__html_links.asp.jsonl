Links allow users to click their way from page to page. HTML Links - Hyperlinks HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element! HTML Links - Syntax The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax: <a href=\" url \"> link text </a> The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader. Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address. Example This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\">Visit W3Schools.com!</a> Try it Yourself  By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue A visited link is underlined and purple An active link is underlined and red Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look! HTML Links - The target Attribute By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values: _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window Example Use target=\"_blank\" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit W3Schools!</a> Try it Yourself  Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
