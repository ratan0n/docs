If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags. Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity. The non-breaking hyphen ( &#8209; ) is used to define a hyphen character () that does not break into a new line.
