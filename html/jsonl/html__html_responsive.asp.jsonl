A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports. What is Responsive Web Design? Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones): Try it Yourself  Setting The Viewport To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages: Example <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> Try it Yourself  This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Without the viewport meta tag: With the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page on a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links above to see the difference. Responsive Images Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size. Using the width Property If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" > Try it Yourself  Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. Using the max-width Property If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: Example <img src=\"img_girl.jpg\" style=\" max-width:100%; height:auto;\"> Try it Yourself  Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. Resize the browser window to see how the image below changes "}]}
