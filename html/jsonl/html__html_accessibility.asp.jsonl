Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible.

Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page. <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3> , and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold . Alternative Text The alt attribute provides a"}]}
