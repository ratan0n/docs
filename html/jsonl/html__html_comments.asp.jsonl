HTML Comment Tag You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax: <!-- Write your comments here --> Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag. Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code. Add Comments With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code: Example <!-- This is a comment --> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- Remember to add more information here --> Try it Yourself  Hide Content Comments can be used to hide content. This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily: Example <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> --> <p>This is a paragraph too.</p> Try it Yourself  You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display. Example Hide a section of HTML code: <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- <p>Look at this cool image:</p> <img border=\"0\" src=\"pic_trulli.jpg\" alt=\"Trulli\"> --> <p>This is a paragraph too.</p> Try it Yourself  Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors. Hide Inline Content Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code. Example Hide a part of a paragraph: <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself  Video: HTML Comments  Previous Next   +1 Track your progress - it's free!
