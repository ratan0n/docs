Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML. Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit. Step 1: Open Notepad (PC) Windows 8 or later: Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad . Windows 7 or earlier: Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac) Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose \"Plain Text\" Then under \"Open and Save\", check the box that says \"Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text\". Then open a new document to place the code. Step 2: Write Some HTML Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>My First Heading</h1> <p>My first paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Step 3: Save the HTML Page Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu. Name the file \"index.htm\" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files). Tip: You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference; it is up to you. Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose \"Open with\").
