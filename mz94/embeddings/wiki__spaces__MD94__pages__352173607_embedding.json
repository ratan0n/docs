  "text": "The Aggregation Session Inspector enables viewing and editing of existing sessions. The data is displayed in a table where each row represents a session, with the session data ordered in columns. It is also possible to edit the contents of the sessions, that is, to change the timeout and the values of the session variables. Aggregation Session Inspector only inspects sessions stored on disk and SQL. Note! Aggregation Session Inspector is only available in the Desktop interface. Open The Aggregation Session Inspector Note! To use the Aggregation Session Inspector, the EC specified as the Storage Host in the Storage tab of the Aggregation profile configuration must be up and running. Searching for sessions Initially, the table is empty and must be populated with data using the Search Sessions dialog.

Changing the value to any time before the current time will have the session timeout during the next execution cycle on its corresponding workflow. Note!

The session will acquire a lock from editing when you have opened this field to modify the timeout, preventing other users from modifying the information while you are editing it. The lock is released when you quit the dialog. Open Edit timeout option Explore Session Displays a new dialog where the session variables may be viewed and if Read Only was disabled in the Search Session dialog, the session variables may be edited as well. Note! This field will be read-only for SQL Storage sessions. You will be able to explore the session, but you will not be able to edit it. Note! The session will acquire a lock from editing when you have opened this field to modify the session, preventing other users from modifying but not reading the information while you are editing it. The lock is released when you quit the dialog. An example of a UDR Viewer dialog: Open UDR Viewer dialog With one or more sessions selected Open Option Description Clear Selection(s) Unselects any highlighted sessions.
