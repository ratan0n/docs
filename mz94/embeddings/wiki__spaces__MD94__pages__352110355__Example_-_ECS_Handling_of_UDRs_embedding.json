  "text": "This section provides an example to demonstrate how the ECS Forwarding agent can send error UDRs to ECS and how the ECS Collection agent can retrieve them. In a typical workflow that processes UDRs, you can implement validation logic to ensure each UDR meets specific criteria. If a UDR is deemed invalid due to duplication, missing mandatory fields, invalid data formats, or failure to decode a corrupted file, it can be forwarded to ECS for further handling. Within the ECS Inspector , error UDRs can be reviewed and corrected by updating the relevant error fields as needed. Once the necessary corrections have been made, your ECS Collection workflow can utilize the ECS Collection agent to retrieve the corrected UDRs by referencing the appropriate Reprocessing Group or Saved Filter (Read Only). These UDRs can be output into new files, which can subsequently be reprocessed with your workflow. Should a UDR fail to reprocess, it can be routed back to ECS for further handling. This section has the following subsections: ECS Forwarding Workflow (UDR) ECS Collection Workflow (UDR)",
