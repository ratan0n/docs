  "text": "The FTPS collection agent collects files from a remote file system and inserts them into a workflow, using the standard FTP (RFC 959) protocol. When activated, the collector establishes an FTPS session towards the remote host. On failure, additional hosts are tried if so configured. On success, the source directory on the remote host is scanned for all files matching the current Filename settings, which are located in the Source tab. In addition, the Filename Sequence service may be used to further control the matching files. All files found will be fed one after the other into the workflow. The agent also offers the possibility to decompress compressed (gzip) files after they have been collected before they are inserted into the workflow. When all the files are successfully processed, the agent stops to await the next activation, scheduled or manually initiated. The FTPS collection agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments. The section contains the following subsections: FTPS Collection Agent Configuration FTPS Collection Agent Transaction Behavior FTPS Collection Agent Input/Output Data and MIM FTPS Collection Agent Events",
