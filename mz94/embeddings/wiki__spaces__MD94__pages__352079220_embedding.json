  "text": "KafkaUDR is the UDR that is populated via APL and routed to the Kafka Producer agent, which in turn writes the data to the specified partition, and the topic set in the Kafka profile. The Kafka Collection agent consumes the data from the Kafka log, from the specified partition(s). The topic is set in the Kafka profile, and places the data in a KafkaUDR . The following fields are included in the KafkaUDR : Field Description Field Description data (bytearray) Producer: This field holds data to be passed to the Kafka log by the Kafka Forwarding Agent (producer). Collector: This field is populated with the data read from the Kafka log. key (bytearray) This field can be used to set a key for the broker's messages. offset (long) This is a read only field. This field is populated by the Kafka Collection agent and contains the offset in the Kafka log from where the message was consumed. partition (short) Producer: This field holds the partition to which the Kafka Forwarding agent (producer) writes the message. If this field is not populated, the partition is chosen randomly. Collector: This field holds the partition from which the message was consumed by the Kafka Collection agent (consumer). timestamp (long) Producer: This is an optional field. A timestamp can be assigned before the UDR to a Kafka producer. Consumer: If you set a timestamp on the producer it will be shown in the corresponding consumer.",
