  "text": "This section describes the Data Masking profile and the Data Masking agent. The agent is a processing agent for batch and real-time workflow configurations. The Data Masking agent can be used to either mask or unmask specified fields in different UDRs to protect the data. It can be used when data is going to be processed in the cloud without involving personal data, for example. The agent enables compliance with regulations around data protection, ensuring personal data is accessed in a controlled manner. Open The agent uses a profile in which you can define the masking method; Crypto, Database, or Hash, as well as which fields to mask/unmask along with additional settings specific for each masking method. You can select Database, Oracle, Postgres, and SAP HANA. In the agent, you can select which of the UDR types configured in the used profile(s) you want the agent to process, as well as how you want the agent to handle unmatching data. Supported features: Encryption/decryption with AES-128 and AES-256 Reading a key from a specific JCEKS keystore Generation and storage of replacement data in a Database Converting input data to random data based on SHA-256 hash Use of multiple profiles in the agent Error handling Logging Caution! Searching, filtering, repairing and masking of UDRs with list and map data types are not supported by Data Veracity. This section has the following subsections: Data Masking Agent Input/Output Data and MIM Data Masking Agent Events Data Masking Profile Masking Methods Data Masking Agent Configuration Data Masking UDRs",
