You can use the following SQL statements for resetting the entry_id. Note! When resetting entry_id, you are required to execute the Archive Cleaner so that newer archive entries will not clash with the older entries. Oracle ALTER SEQUENCE MZOWNER.SEQ_ARCHIVE_ENTRY_ID CYCLE; PostgreSQL ALTER SEQUENCE mzowner.archive_entries_entry_id_seq CYCLE;",
