  "text": "This section describes the Analysis agent. This is a processing agent for batch and real-time workflow configurations. The Analysis agent is used to process UDRs and, for example, to generate audit data and dispatch events in the system. These activities are established by editing the rich programming language - Analysis Programming Language (APL). The Analysis agent, depending on the configured APL code, can either be a pure processing agent with the ability to examine, alter, route and clone each UDR routed to the agent or it can be the final destination for a UDR in the workflow; a sort of forwarding agent. See the APL Reference Guide for descriptions of the Analysis Programming Language, APL, and the available functions. The Analysis agent can be part of both batch and real-time workflows. Differences in the configuration are described in the section Realtime Workflows in Analysis Agent Configuration . Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: UDR structure and content Basic programming For information about Terms and Abbreviations used in this section, see the Terminology document. This section has the following subsections: Analysis Agent Events Analysis Agent Input/Output Data and MIM Analysis Agent Configuration Analysis Agent Syntax Highlighting and Right-click Menu Analysis Agent Assignment and Cloning Analysis Agent Transaction Behavior - Batch Workflows Analysis Agent Input and Output Types",
