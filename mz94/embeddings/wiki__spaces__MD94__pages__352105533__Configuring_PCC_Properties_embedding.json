  "text": "The following steps are required in order for MediationZone to connect to MySQL Cluster: Copy the following files from located in the /[MYSQLDIR]/lib/mysql folder in [CZ], to the /usr/lib directory in each [EZ]: - libndbclient.so - private/libcrypto.so.3 - private/libssl.so.3 and ensure the subdirectory in the path is retained. Hint! Use the property java.library.path on container level to set a different directory than /usr/lib . Replace <MYSQLDIR> with the home directory of the MySQL Cluster installation. The path must be added to the default value, MZ_HOME/common/lib/native , which is set on cell level. $ mzsh topo set topo://container:<container>/val:common.java.library.path '${mz.home}/\"common/lib/native:<MYSQLDIR>/lib/mysql\"' Once installed, the pcc.properties file, located in the $ MZ_HOME/etc folder in [EC] , needs to be edited to connect to the host and port of the Management Node. Configure the following properties: Property Description Property Description mz.pcc.storage.lock.timeout The default value of this property is 3000 ms. It is recommended to also set the MySQL Cluster parameter TransactionInactiveTimeout to 3000 ms to avoid timeout errors due to locked database records. mz.pcc.storage.mysqlc.database This property should contain the name of the database created, e g pcc . mz.pcc.storage.mysqlc.host This property should contain the host name of the Management Node. If more than one Management Node is being used, comma separated host names should be specified. mz.pcc.storage.mysqlc.port This property should contain the port of the Management Node process, e g 1186 . mz.pcc.config.storage.class This property should be set to com.digitalroute.pcc.storage.config.mysqlc.MySQLClusterStorage . mz.pcc.bucket.storage.class This property should be set to com.digitalroute.pcc.buckets.storage.mysqlc.MySQLClusterBucketStorage . In order for the Execution Context to be able to locate the pcc.properties file, the Execution Context property mz.pcc.properties must be set in the STR: mzsh topo set topo://container:<container>/pico:<pico>/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties <path> Example - Setting mz.pcc.properties mzsh topo set topo://container:exec1/pico:ec1/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties '${mz.home}/\"etc/pcc.properties\"' mzsh topo set topo://container:exec1/pico:ec2/val:config.properties.mz.pcc.properties '${mz.home}/\"etc/pcc.properties\"' Note!
