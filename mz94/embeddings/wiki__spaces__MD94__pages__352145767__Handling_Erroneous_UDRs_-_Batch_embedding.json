Example - Handling erroneous UDRs in a batch workflow Consider the following workflow: Open The SQL forwarding agent identifies the asciiSEQ_TI UDR as erroneous, and creates an errorUDR that wraps together the original UDR with the error message that was generated: Open The erroneous UDR before and after SQL forwarding: Open If you have selected the option Upon Exception, route the entire executed batch instead of a single UDR, an errorUDRList UDR is routed instead: Open",
