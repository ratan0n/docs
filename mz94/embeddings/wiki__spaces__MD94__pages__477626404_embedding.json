In the preceding Collection Agent, select the GZIP Decompression option. Link the collection agent to the following node. Black Box This is a new feature that allows for all workflows to be imported, even if agents part of the configuration are not present in the installation. Missing agents will be represented as Black Boxes. This can happen for any of the following reasons: The agent is a DTK extensions that has not been included in the installation. Please revisit the previous step that handles DTK extension upgrades. The agent is not included in the license. Please request a new license. The agent is not available in the new version. If you wish to replace a Black Box agent, please see section: Black Box for Deprecated or Unsupported Agents Configuration Spaces There is no replacement for configuration spaces. To easily switch between different versions of a configuration, workflow packages can be used (for more information please see Workflow Packages ). Export each configuration space to an export of its own. Note that you will only get the latest version of each configuration in the export. If you would like to keep historical versions, we recommend that a version control system is used. Import the configuration to the new system, manage potential configuration changes according to information on this page. Create Workflow Packages. Conditional Trace (legacy) Verify if your configuration contains the feature: Manage the change in your 9.4 installation. Go to the Configuration directory of the export <exp file>/Configuration/<folder>. This command will list the name of the configurations that use the feature. > ls -l *Trace* In the Web UI of the old system http://<platform host>:<web interface port>/mz/ , find the Conditional Trace configurations. Open up the Conditional Trace Template. Recreate based on the old configurations. Traces are started from the UI. There is currently no replacement for the curl command. Export/Import Directory Mode There is no replacement for Directory Mode. However, if you unpack the compressed version of an export you will get exactly the same result as the former Directory Mode. > unzip <export file>.zip Execution Context Stand Alone (ECSA) The ECSAs have been replaced with regular ECs and the configuration option Standalone Workflow (present in the Workflow Properties UI, the Execution tab). During a configuration import the conversion will be done automatically. ECs running standalone workflow have the same functionality as ECSAs. Kafka - Embedded cluster Embedded Kafka is not supported. You may want to move the data to a new stand alone Kafka Cluster: Install a stand alone Kafka Cluster Create new workflows in your 8.3 deployment that move the data from your embedded Kafka Cluster to the new stand alone cluster. Modify your original Kafka workflows to collect/forward to the new stand alone Kafka cluster. Remove the moved data: $MZ_HOME/storage/. Keystore Profile The Key Manager settings from the old system will automatically be imported as Security Profiles in the new system. Agents in workflows using the Key Manager configuration will also automatically be updated to using the new Security Profile. System Insight Verify if your configuration contains the feature: Manage the change in your 9.4 installation. Go to the workflow directory/directories of the configuration export <exp file>/Configuration/<folder>/Workflow. This command will list the workflows (if any) that uses the feature. > grep -nE -B 1 \"\"Workflow\"|devkit.systeminsight\" * | grep \"\"Name\"\" Install Prometheus and configure MZ according to instructions Setting up Prometheus . Note that the existing data in the Influx database cannot be migrated.

They have to be replaced with completely new workflows. For instance, export data from Prometheus and collect to a workflow using a File Collection Agent. * Cloudwatch extension and REST client have also been removed.",
