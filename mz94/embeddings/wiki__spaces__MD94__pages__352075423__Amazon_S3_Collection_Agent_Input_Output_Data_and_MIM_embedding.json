  "text": "Input/Output Data The input/output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The agent produces bytearray types. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the ge neral MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes MIM Value Description MIM Value Description File Modified Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the file is stored in the collection directory. File Modified Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. File Retrieval Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the file processing starts. File Retrieval Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source File Size This MIM parameter contains the file size, in bytes, of the source file. Source File Size is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Filename This MIM parameter contains the name of the currently processed file, as defined at the source. Source Filename is of the string type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Filenames This MIM parameter contains a list of file names of the files that are about to be collected from the current collection directory. Note! When the agent collects from multiple directories, the MIM value is cleared after collection of each directory. Then, the MIM value is updated with the listing of the next directory. Source Filenames is of the list<any> type and is defined as a Header MIM context type. Source File Count This MIM parameter contains the number of files, available to this instance for collection at startup. The value is constant throughout the execution of the workflow, even if more files arrive during the execution. The new files will not be collected until the next execution. Source File Count is of the long type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Pathname This MIM parameter contains the path to the directory where the file currently under processing is located. Source Pathname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. The path is defined in the Amazon S3 tab. Source Files Left This parameter contains the number of source files that are yet to be collected. This is the number that appears in the Execution Manager backlog. Source Files Left is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Accesses The agent does not itself access any MIM resources.",
