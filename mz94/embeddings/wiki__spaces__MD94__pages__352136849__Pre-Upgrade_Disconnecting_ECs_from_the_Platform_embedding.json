  "text": "Execution Containers (ECs) can operate independently from the Platform. If the EC is installed in a separate container from the Platform and you want workflows to continue running during the Platform upgrade to minimize downtime, you can disconnect the ECs from the Platform before upgrading. Hint! Minimize Downtime To reduce downtime during the upgrade process: Use separate remote execution containers for ECs  This ensures that upgrading one EC does not impact others. Distribute workflows across multiple ECs  By running workflows on different ECs, some workflows can continue processing while one EC is being upgraded. If the EC is not intended to run standalone, there is no need to manually disconnect or shut it down, as the upgrade process will handle this automatically. To Disconnect ECs: Before Upgrading the Platform: Disconnect ECs from the Platform with command: mzsh mzadmin/<password> disconnect <ec name> After disconnection, the EC status will appear as unreachable in pico-view. mzsh topo show pico-view While disconnected, ECs may still attempt to communicate with the Platform, resulting in failed attempts and warning messages in the log files (e.g., \"No open connection to <Platform host>\" ). These warnings can be ignored. It is recommended to continuously monitor the pico log files for ECs using: $ tail -f <pico log file> Workflows running on disconnected ECs will continue to operate, however, their state in Execution Manager will be displayed as Unreachable since the Platform can no longer track their status. After Platform Upgrade: After the Platform upgrade is complete and restarted, workflows running on ECs will no longer appear in the Execution Manager, and the EC status will be shown as not-started in pico-view. However, the workflows will continue running on ECs. Do not restart EC, as this will cause the workflows to stop. Proceed to upgrade Execution Container.",
