The agent relies on the SAP CC Notification Client (NotificationServiceClient) to handle all communication with the SAP CC instances. For more information regarding this SAP AP I, refer to the NotificationServiceClient SAP documentation . Note! The SAP CC Notification API does not support any acknowledgment that a notification has been received by a client.
