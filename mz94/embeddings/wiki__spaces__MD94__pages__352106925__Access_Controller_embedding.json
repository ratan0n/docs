While the Write permission means that the members can perform changes or create actions in that application. Note! By default, members of the predefined group Administrator have full permissions for the Access Controller. You can enable these permissions for other groups as well. When no members belong in the Administrator group, all users with full permissions for the Access Controller will have Administration access. It is not possible to disable or delete the last active user with full permissions for the Access Controller. This is to prevent system lockout.
