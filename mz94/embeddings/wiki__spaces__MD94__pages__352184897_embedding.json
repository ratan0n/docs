  "text": "Usage usage: startup [ -e ] [ -j ] [ -f ] [ -q ] <server process>... This command is used to start pico instances. Note! This command is valid only for the MZ_HOME owner. The Platform must be started before any other pico instance. If there is a problem during startup an error message will be shown and more information will be visible in the Platform log. This command will not terminate until a pico instance has reported back that it is up and running. If you have specified more than one pico instance in the arguments, it will not continue with the next one until the previous instance has reported that it is up and running. Options The command accepts the following options: Option Description Option Description [-e <property=value>] Use this option to set or override a system property. This is useful for test purposes but not recommended for production environments. Example. Setting properties in the mzsh startup command. $ mzsh startup platform ec1 -e pico.log.level=\"FINEST\" [-f] Use this option to force start of an existing pico instance that is unreachable. Note! When you want to start a pico instance that is already started but unreachable, you must first delete it or use the -f option. For further information, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/Klr9F in the https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/zjL8F . [-q] Use this option to generate less or no messages in the output. Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the startup command: Code Description Code Description -1 Will be returned if there is an old pico instance running or if the remote (../temp/.remote) file cannot be deleted. 0 Will be returned if the command was successful, or if the pico instances are already started. 1 Will be returned if the JVM failed to start. (The JVM has logged too much on stderr.) 102 Will be returned if the JVM failed to start. (The timeout on the callback from the JVM was exceeded.) 103 Will be returned if the command has been interrupted with CTRL-C. 104 Will be returned if the JVM failed to start. (The JVM started with (a) critical error(s).)",
