General Tab The General tab consists of three different sections: Python code for the execute block, input/output UDR types, and Interpreter configuration. Open The Python collection agent configuration - General tab Setting Description Setting Description Code Area This is the text area where you enter your code, see Python Writer's Guide for further information. The entered code will be color-coded depending on the code type, and for input assistance, a pop-up menu is available. Below the text area, there are line, column, and position indicators. See Python Code Editor Assistance . Input Types Enables selection of UDR Types. One or several UDR Types that the agent expects to receive may be selected. Set To Input Automatically selects the UDR Type distributed by an agent routing back to the Python collection agent. Output Types Select the output types that you have. Output Routes Enter the routes that each output type is sent out on. Interpreter Select which Python Interpreter Profile you want to use. If no selection is made the interpreter that has been set as default in the Python Manager will be used. MIM Tab In the tab, you can set the MIMs that you want the Python collection agent to publish.
