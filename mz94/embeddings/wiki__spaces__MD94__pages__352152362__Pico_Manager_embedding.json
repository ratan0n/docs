  "text": "All servers, processes, and threads related to an executing MediationZone instance are controlled and monitored using the Pico Manager. It also enforces potential restrictions in regards to hardware configurations that might apply for workflows and applications. Using the Pico Manager, the system administrator can: Register new picos. Start, stop, delete and change configuration of existing picos. Examples of configuration for an Execution Context (EC) pico are memory allocation, date formats, ports, java and security settings. Open Example of Pico Management usage The EC picos can also be assigned to groups. These groups simplify transfer of configurations between systems by providing an added layer of abstraction. For instance, the execution settings of a workflow configuration can be setup for a group instead of several individual ECs. This is useful since the name and number of ECs may differ between systems. Open Example of Pico Viewer usage To improve security, MediationZone can be configured to deny any new Desktop client access to the system until the system administrator has registered the IP address in the Pico Manager.",
