  "text": "Amazon RDS provides two different methods for backing up and restoring your Amazon database instances, automated backups and database snapshots. Automated backups automatically back up your database instance during a specific, user-definable backup window, and keeps the backups for a limited, user-specified period of time (called the backup retention period); you can later recover your database to any point in time during that retention period. database snapshots are user-initiated backups that enable you to back up your database instance to a known state, and restore to that specific state at any time. Amazon RDS keeps all database snapshots until you delete them. For more information about these methods, see the Amazon Web Services documentation. How to perform automated backups: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html How to perform snapshot backups: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.BackingUpAndRestoringAmazonRDSInstances.html To restore the database from a backup: Shut down MediationZone. Restore the database according to the Amazon Web Services documentation. If you are restoring from an automated backup, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html . If you are restoring from a snapshot, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html . Note! This step requires that a new database instance is created.
