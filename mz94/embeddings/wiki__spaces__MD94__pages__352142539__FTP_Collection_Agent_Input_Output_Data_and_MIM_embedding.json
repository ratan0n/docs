  "text": "Input/Output Data The Input/Output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The agent produces bytearray types. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM par ameter s, see Administration and Management . Publishes MIM Parameter Description File Retrieval Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the file transfer started. File Retrieval Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Filename This MIM parameter contains the name of the currently processed file, as defined at the source. Source Filename is of the string type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Note! When collecting files from a VAX file system, the name of the source file will contain both path and filename. Source Filenames This MIM parameter contains a list of file names of the files that are about to be collected from the current collection directory. Note! When the agent collects from multiple directories, the MIM value is cleared after collection of each directory. Then, the MIM value is updated with the listing of the next directory. Source Filenames is of the list<any> type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Note! When collecting files from a VAX file system, the name of the source file will contain both path and filename. Source File Count This MIM parameter contains the number of files that were available to this instance for collection at startup. The value is static throughout the execution of the workflow, even if more files arrive during the execution. The new files will not be collected until the next execution. Source File Count is of the long type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Files Left This parameter contains the number of source files that are yet to be collected. This is the number that appears in the Execution Manager in Running Workflows tab in the Backlog column. Source Files Left is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source File Size This parameter provides the size of the file that is about to be read. The file is located on the server. Source File Size is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Host This MIM parameter contains the name of the host from which files are collected, as defined in the Source or Advanced tabs. Source Host is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Pathname This MIM parameter contains the path name, as defined in the Source tab. Source Pathname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Username This MIM parameter contains the login user name, as defined in the Source tab. Source Username is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Accesses The agent does not itself access any MIM resources.",
