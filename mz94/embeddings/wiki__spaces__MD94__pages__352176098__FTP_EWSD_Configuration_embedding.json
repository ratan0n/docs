  "text": "You open the FTP EWSD collection agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration. To open the configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add agent and select FTP EWSD from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. The dialog contains two tabs ; Switch and Advanced . Switch Tab This tab contains the remote host and source file parameters. Open FTP/EWSD agent configuration dialog - Switch tab Setting Description Setting Description Host Name Enter the host name or the IP address of the switch that is to be connected. User Name Enter the name of the user from whose account on the remote Switch the FTP session is created. Password Enter the user password. Filename Enter the name the cyclic file that the agent should collect. Remote File is Cyclic Select this checkbox to enable a transaction safe retrieval of data from the switch. This is useful when you want to retrieve statistical switch data. Multiple File View Select this checkbox to enable sectioning and thereby a more effective data management of the file. Clear to stay in single file view. For further information see Multiple File View Option in FTP EWSD Agent . Advanced Tab This tab enables you to specify advanced use of the FTP service parameters. Open The FTP/EWSD agent configuration dialog - Advanced tab Item Description Item Description Command Port Enter a number between 1 and 65535 to define the port that the FTP service will use to communicate with the agent from a remote switch. Timeout (sec) Enter the maximum length of time, in seconds, while the agent should await a reply after sending a command, before a timeout is called. 0 (zero) means \"wait forever\". Number of Retries The number of times to retry upon TCP communication failure. This is for the FTP command channel only. An IO failure during the file transfer will not trigger retries. If value set to O no retires will be done. Delay (sec) Enter the length of the delay period between each connection atempt. Local Data Port Enter the number of the port through which the agent should expect input data connections ( FTP PORT command). Enter 0 (zero) to have the operating system select a random port number that is not being used currently, according to the system specifications for each data connection. Enter a non-zero value to have the agent use the same local port for all the data connections. Value range: 0 - 65535. Local Address Enter the IP-address of the local endpoint, used both for commands and for data transmission channels. Keep Alive Select this check box to have the agent tell the system to perform a continuous test that the remote host is running. This enables you to identify bad connections. Note! The keep-alive interval (Idle time) is system dependent. Default is 7200 000 (milliseconds). Passive Mode (PASV) Select this check box when using an FTP passive mode connection. Currently, Siemens does not support this option. However, some firewalls require passive mode. Binary Transfer Select this checkbox to enable binary transfer. Clear to enable ascii transfer. FTP Command Trace Select this checkbox to debug the communication with the remote switch. See a log of the commands and responses in the workflow editor Event Area. The LIST command results are traced as well. Release File Slice After Retrieval Select this checkbox to release all the file slices after successful retrieval. File release is initiated by the FTP delete command. Automatic Seq No Assignment Select this checkbox to enable automatic numbering of the file slices in Multiple File View mode. If this option is checked, the number management is done in SAMAR. Don't Collect The Active File Slice Select this checkbox to have the agent collect only file slices that are prior to the active one.",
