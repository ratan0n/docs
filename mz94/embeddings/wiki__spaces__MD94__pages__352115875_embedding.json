  "text": "Task workflows execute system housekeeping tasks such as removing files or cleaning up database tables. The Task Workflow agents are: 1 Data Hub Task Agent 2 Data Veracity Task Agent 3 Python Task Agent 3.1 General 3.2 MIM 4 SQL Agent 5 Script Agent 6 Unit Test Runner Agent Data Hub Task Agent The Data Hub Task agent is explained in detail in Data Hub Task Agent . Data Veracity Task Agent The Data Veracity Task Agent is explained in detail in Data Veracity Task Agent . Python Task Agent The Python Task Agent runs Python scripts and is configured in two tabs  General where the code is entered and MIM where MIM values can be freely assigned. General Open The Python collection agent configuration - General tab In the General tab, you enter the selected code string that needs to be executed in a task workflow. You can Validate the input code and confirm your choice by clicking on the OK button. Setting Description Setting Description Code Area This is the text area where you enter your code, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/31D8F for further information. Entered code is color-coded depending on the code type and a pop up menu is available for input assistance. Below the text area, there are line, column, and position indicators, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/H9D9F . Interpreter Select which https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/LtD8F you want to use. If no selection is made the interpreter that has been set as default in the https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/yzX9F will be used. MIM Open The MIM tab of the Python Task Agent You can assign MIM values and edit entries using the Add, Edit, Remove, Up , and Down buttons. When you click on the Add button the Add MIM dialog box will open and you can insert the relevant MIM values. Open The Add MIM dialog box Setting Description Setting Description Assigned Select the target assignee to which the MIM will be bound. Name Enter the name of the MIM value Type Select the data type, you can choose from the following supported data types: any, boolean, date, double, int, long , and string . SQL Agent The SQL agent executes an SQL statement or script in the database specified by a database profile. Open SQL agent configuration Setting Description Setting Description Database Click Browse... to select a Database profile. For further information about how to configure a Database profile, see Database Profile . SQL Statement Enter a PL/SQL script or SQL statements. Note! Group several SQL statements within a block. For a single SQL statement omit the semicolon (;) at the end. Script Agent This agent runs a shell script or other executable located on the filesystem of an EC. The workflow will stop when it receives an exit code from the script. If the script returns a non-zero exit code, the workflow will abort. Output to stdout will appear in the debug output from the agent. Warning! It is strongly recommended that you run script task workflows on a separate EC. Running script task workflows on the same EC as other workflows may cause unpredictable errors and loss of data. During a short time before exec() runs the actual script, fork() allocates the same amount of memory for the script as used for the EC. If the memory is not available, the EC will abort with an out-of-memory error and must then be restarted. Open Script agent configuration Setting Description Setting Description Script Name Enter the absolute path and name of the script file or executable that will perform the task. You may omit the path if it is not required by the shell. For instance, to remove files or directories you can simply enter rm or rmdir . Parameters Enter the arguments and options expected by the script. The value will be passed as-is to the shell, except for carriage return characters, which will be handled as a blank spaces. To call the script without options parameters, leave this field blank. Unit Test Runner Agent This task agent executes unit tests. You can customize the queries and define the exact location where the reports are saved. Open Unit Test Runner Agent configuration Setting Description Setting Description Test Discovery Settings Workflow Package This is an optional field where you can select a workflow package to run unit tests from. Query Enter the unit test run query All Select this option to enter \"all\" into the query field. Add folder... Select this option to enter the add folder code into the query field. Add name... Select this option to enter a unit test. Report Settings Report Enter the target directory where the reports will be saved. Interpreter Settings Profile Select the Interpreter profile.",
