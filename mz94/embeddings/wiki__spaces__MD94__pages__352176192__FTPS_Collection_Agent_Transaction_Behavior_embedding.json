  "text": "This section includes information about the FTPS collection agent transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Transactions in Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that change the state of the currently processed file. Command Description Begin Batch This command is emitted before the first byte of each collected file is fed into a workflow. End Batch This command is emitted after the last byte of each collected file is fed into the system. Retrieves Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch to ECS. Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on workflow level (set in the workflow properties) is configured to abort the workflow, the agent never receives the last Cancel Batch message. In this situation ECS is not involved, and the file is not moved. APL code where Hint End Batch is followed by a Cancel Batch always results in workflow abort. Make sure to design the APL code to first evaluate the Cancel Batch criteria to avoid this sort of behavior. Hint End Batch If a Hint End Batch message is received, the collector splits the batch at the end of the current block processed (32 kB), provided that no UDR is split. If the block end occurs within a UDR, the batch is split at the end of the preceding UDR. After a batch split, the collector emits an End Batch Message, followed by a Begin Batch message (provided that there is data in the subsequent block).",
