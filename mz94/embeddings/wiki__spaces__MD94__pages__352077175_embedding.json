  "text": "The ECS Restricted Fields and Bulk Edit features are currently available only in Legacy Desktop. The Desktop version of this feature is coming soon. The ECS Inspector allows users to inspect and maintain UDRs and batches in the ECS, view and edit their content, and add them to ECS Reprocessing Groups for collection by an ECS agent. Certain fields can be restricted from editing. All actions performed in the ECS Inspector will be logged in the system log . Apart from sending a UDR or batch to the ECS, workflows can associate user-defined information with ECS data. For UDRs, the Error Code and MIM information may contain user-defined information. For canceled batches, the Error UDR and Cancel Message may contain user-defined information. Note! The data itself is not saved to the database, only a reference to the data. Physically, the ECS data is saved in the directory defined by the property mz.ecs.path found in platform.conf . The default path is MZ_HOME/ecs . If the mz.ecs.path parameter is changed, the new path takes effect with the next data insertion into the ECS. Existing data remains in its current location and must not be moved. If moving is necessary, transfer the old directory's content to the new one and create a soft link from the old to the new location. Note! Take precautions when updating Ultra formats. Data cannot be collected from the ECS if the corresponding UDR has been renamed. If the format definition changes, data collection is still possible. Format changes are handled as follows: Added or renamed fields are assigned default values. Removed fields are ignored. Fields with changed data types are assigned default values. This section has the following subsections: ECS Inspector Searching with the ECS Inspector Managing ECS Filters Managing ECS Error Codes Managing ECS Reprocessing Groups Configuring ECS Restricted Fields Configuring ECS Searchable Fields",
