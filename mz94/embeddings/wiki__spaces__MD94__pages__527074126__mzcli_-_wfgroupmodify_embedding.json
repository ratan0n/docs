  "text": "Usage usage: wfgroupmodify -group <name> (-memberwf <wf> | -membergrp <grp>) [-prereqwf <wf> ...] [-prereqgrp <grp> ...] [q] This command enables you to modify the prerequisites list for an entry in a workflow group. The workflow group name and workflow group member name are required parameters. Only one workflow group member at a time can be modified by the command. Options Options Description Options Description [-group <group name>] Enter the name of the workflow group that you want to modify. (-memberwf wf | -membergrp GRP) Enter the name of the member that you want to modify, either a workflow or a workflow group. [-prereqwf wf...] Enter a list of workflows that the prerequisites list should include. Note! Excluding this parameter sets the workflow prerequisites list of the workflow group to be empty. [-prereqgrp grp...] Enter a list of workflow groups that the prerequisites list should include. Note! Excluding this parameter sets the workflow-groups prerequisites list of the workflow group to be empty. [q] Quiet mode. Use this parameter to eliminate the display of any report during execution. Examples Example - Workflow Packages A group with workflows inside a package or several prerequisites in a package as shown respectively: $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group XE-7088.GroupOfPackageWFs -memberwf testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 -prereqwf testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 Modifying testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 Prerequisites set to - Workflow testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group XE-7088.GroupOfPackageWFs -memberwf testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 -prereqwf testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_2 testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_3 testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_4 Modifying testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 Prerequisites set to - Workflow testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_2 - Workflow testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_3 - Workflow testworkflows_1.0@XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_4 In this example: The group being modified is named GroupOfPackageWFs , inside the folder XE-7088 . The member workflows in this case are both called workflow_1 , one belonging to the template AsciiProcessingWF and the prerequisite one belonging to the template DiskToArchivingTemplate , both located in the folder XE-7088 . And both workflows are part of the package testworkflows_1.0. Above example sets workflow_2, workflow_3 and workflow_4. If you previously had workflow_1 as prerequisite as in the previous example, that would be replaced. This means that any prerequisites you want to set all have to be specified in the same run. You cannot modify a workflow group if it is part of a package and this is the reason that the GroupOfPackageWFs is not inside the package. Example - Execution $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group TestWorkflows.AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup -memberwf TestWorkflows.IWFDecodeToWFBridge.workflow_1 -prereqwf TestWorkflows.DiskAsciiCollToWFBridge.workflow_1 Modifying TestWorkflows.IWFDecodeToWFBridge.workflow_1 Prerequisites set to - Workflow TestWorkflows.DiskAsciiCollToWFBridge.workflow_1 In this example: AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup is the name of the workflow group. TestWorkflows is the folder where the Workflow group is present. You have specified that the workflow IWFDecodeToWFBridge.workflow_1 should not start until DiskAsciiCollToWFBridge.workflow_1 has finished running. Example - No Workflow Above $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group TestWorkflows.CollAndProcGroup -memberwf TestWorkflows.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 -prereqwf TestWorkflows.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 TestWorkflows.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_2 TestWorkflows.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_3 In this example: There is no member TestWorkflows.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 (Workflow) above TestWorkflows.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 to have as prerequisite. Even though the command sets workflows as prerequisites of other workflows, it depends on the order specified in the workflow group editor, which you cannot change from the terminal. Example - Multiple Workflows You can set several workflows (or groups) to be prerequisites of one workflow, for example: $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group XE-7088.CollAndProcGroup -memberwf XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 -prereqwf XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 XE7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_2 XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_3 Modifying XE-7088.AsciiProcessingWF.workflow_1 Prerequisites set to - Workflow XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_1 - Workflow XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_2 - Workflow XE-7088.DiskToArchivingTemplate.workflow_3 Example - Group of Workflow Groups A group of workflow groups work same as group of workflows: $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group XE-7088.GroupOfGroups -membergrp TestWorkflows.AsciiTestWFGroup -prereqgrp TestWorkflows.AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup XE-7088.CollAndProcGroup Modifying TestWorkflows.AsciiTestWFGroup Prerequisites set to - Workflow Group TestWorkflows.AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup - Workflow Group XE-7088.CollAndProcGroup Example - No Workflow Group Above And just like for workflows, the sequence is important: $ mzsh mzadmin/dr wfgroupmodify -group XE-7088.GroupOfGroups -membergrp TestWorkflows.AsciiFromRTProcToBillingGroup -prereqgrp TestWorkflows.AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup XE-7088.CollAndProcGroup There is no member TestWorkflows.AsciiWFBToRtPreprocessingGroup (workflow group) above TestWorkflows.AsciiFromRTProcToBillingGroup to have as prerequisite. Note! All the members mentioned need to be members when the command is used. For example, if you set workflow_4 as a prerequisite for workflow_3 , it only works if both workflow_4 and workflow_3 are members of the group. Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the wfgroupmodify command: Code Description Code Description 0 Will be returned if the command was successful. 1 Will be returned if the command was unsuccessful.",
