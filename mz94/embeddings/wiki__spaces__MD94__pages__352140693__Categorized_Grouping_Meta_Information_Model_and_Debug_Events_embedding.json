The MIM can be true during the first transaction of an activation but will always be false on the subsequent transactions within the same activation. Using Clean Storage is of the boolean type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Accesses MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Source File Count Received from the collector. This is accessed if Close on Deactivation is enabled. Note! APL offers the possibility of both publishing and accessing MIM resources and values. For a listing of general MIM p arameters , see Administration and Management . Debug Events Debug messages are dispatched in debug mode. During execution, the messages are displayed in the Workflow Monitor. You can configure Event Notifications that are triggered when a debug message is dispatched.
