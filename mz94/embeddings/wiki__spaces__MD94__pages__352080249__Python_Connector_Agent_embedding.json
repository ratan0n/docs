  "text": "The Python Connector agent is a collection agent for real-time workflows, that allows you to explore and test workflows using an exploration tool. The Python Connector agent is similar to the Python processing agent but the Python Connector agent enables interaction between an exploration tool, e.g. Jupyter Notebook, and workflows during exploration and test. This gives you access to all the UDRs, routes, APL functions etc that are part of MediationZone with the flexibility that you can choose an interactive console or script that suits you, in which to test and explore your code. Open Example workflow including the Python Connector agent This section includes the following subsections: Python Connector UDR Types Python Connector Agent Configuration Python Connector Agent Input/Output Data and MIM Python Connector Agent Events - Real-Time Connecting Using SSL",
