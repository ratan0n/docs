Currently, the profile can be used with the following profilse and agents: GCP PubSub Agents GCP PubSup Profile GCP BigQuery Agent Menus The contents of the menus in the menu bar may change depending on which configuration type has been opened in the currently displayed tab. The GCP Profile uses the standard menu items and buttons that are visible for all configurations, and these are described in Configuration View . The Edit menu is specific for the GCP Profile configurations.
