Upon first entry, you will see the landing page: Open The system gathers the current number of New and Reprocessed UDRs and batches per Error Code from the ECS. The ECS Statistics window allows for inspection of these calculated values, as well as more specific views since the data may be inspected down to the Error Code level. The data may also be exported. Note! The ECS Statistics data is gathered and calculated using a system task called ECS_Maintenance. See ECS Maintenance System Task for more information. If you want to change the scheduling of the task, this is done in the ECS_Maintenance_grp configuration. If the ECS_Maintenance system task is scheduled to be executed with a time interval of less than an hour, the statistical data will be gathered every hour. Initially, the ECS Statistics view is empty. It is populated by performing a search. Open Setting Description Setting Description Filter Shows the Filter dialog. For further information, see the section below, Searching the ECS Statistics . Export Allowing the statistics to be exported in csv format. Searching the ECS Statistics To populate the ECS Statistics window, click Filter Statistics and specify the search criteria. If no limitations are entered in the Search ECS Statistics dialog, a basic search is performed. For further information, see the section below, Basic Search. Open Setting Description Setting Description Data Type Determines if the search is made for Batches or UDRs. Error Codes A list of available Error Codes, as defined in the ECS. To search for more Error Codes, click the Dropdown button below the Error Code list or use Select all button to select all available Error Codes. Period Select Period to search for a specific time period when the data was entered into the ECS. Example - For Legacy Desktop Only 100000 entries at a time can be browsed. If the search results are more than 100 000 entries, bulk operations must be repeated for the next entries, up to the next 100000. Basic Search If no limitations are entered in the Filter dialog, a basic table will be shown. Click the View Button in the table to display the spread of Error Codes into a pie chart. If up to nine Error Code types for the same date are named, these are all shown in the graph. If nine or more Error Code types are present, the nine most common Error Code types are shown, and the rest are grouped into the Other category. Open Open Click the View Button to view the Pie Chart. Setting Description Setting Description Date The date and time when the values were calculated. New The amount of new errors currently in the ECS on the given date. Reprocessed The amount of reprocessed errors currently in the ECS on the given date. Value Type Select to display statistics for either New or Reprocessed UDRs or batches. Error Code Search If a specific Error Code search is done, three new columns related to the Error Codes are added to the table. Open Setting Description Setting Description Error Code The Error Code column is visible when the search is made based on Error Codes. It displays the error code name. Newest The last time the error occurred. Oldest The first time the error occurred. Error Code Report Shows the number of UDRs attached to the selected Error Code.",
