Test configuration can be exported and imported the same way as any other configuration. Examples of available test functions: Examine events, logs and produced files by a workflow. Test global APL functions. It is possible to create and populate UDRs and pass on as parameters. Produced test reports are in the format of Unit XML files. Open Unit Test Configuration UI, and resulting debug information in the Workflow Monitor UI.",
