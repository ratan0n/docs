  "text": "This section describes the FTAM EWSD agent. This is a collection agent for batch workflow configurations. Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: FTAM The FTAM EWSD agent allows files from Siemens EWSD switches to be collected and inserted into a workflow using the FTAM protocol. The agent does not communicate directly with the EWSD switch. Instead, it goes via the FTAM Interface service that must be running on a host in the network. The advantage of this implementation is that only one host has to be equipped with FTAM software. For further information about how the FTAM Interface service is maneuvered, see FTAM EWSD Interface Service . The FTAM EWSD usually collects a cyclic file, since that is how Siemens EWSD switches generate traffic data. When activated, the agent connects to the FTAM Interface service and requests the new data. The switch keeps track of the data to be collected by using two parameters: begin and end copy area pointer . After the FTAM EWSD agent has safely collected the data, a delete request is issued, resulting in the begin copy area pointer being moved to the end. The collected data is saved in files, each containing one copy area (all data from one(1) activation). The FTAM EWSD agent may not be combined with other collectors in the same workflow. Note! Since the FTAM/EWSD agent is the active part, it has to be scheduled to be invoked periodically. The section contains the following subsections: FTAM EWSD Agent Configuration FTAM EWSD Agent Transaction Behavior FTAM EWSD Agent Input/Output Data and MIM FTAM EWSD Agent Events FTAM EWSD Interface Service",
