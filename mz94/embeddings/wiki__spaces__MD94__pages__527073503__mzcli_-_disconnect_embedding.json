  "text": "Usage usage: disconnect [ -q ] [ -verbose ] <running pico process> ... Switches: -q Quiet mode -verbose Verbose mode With this command you can let an EC and its workflows run in disconnected mode during Platform upgrade, in order to avoid downtime. Note! Since a batch workflow cannot run without contact with the Platform, this command should only be executed for ECs running real-time workflows. If an EC running a batch workflow is disconnected, the workflow will abort. When the EC has been disconnected, it will continue executing real-time workflows without interference from the Platform and there will be no risk that new software is downloaded to the EC during the Platform upgrade. When the upgrade is done, each EC has to be restarted in order to re-connect to the Platform. Options Option Description Option Description [-q] Quiet mode. Use this option to eliminate the display of any report during execution. [-verbose] Verbose mode. This option will print extended error information. By running the disconnect command from the Platform without any options, all running ECs, will be disconnected without the need to login to each machine and disconnect them one by one: MZ>> disconnect Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the disconnect command: Code Description Code Description 0 Will be returned if the command was successful. 1 Will be returned if an EC process is not running. 2 Will be returned if an EC cannot be reached due to a communication problem. 3 Will be returned if an EC does not exist. 10 Will be returned if the Platform cannot be reached due to communication problems. 11 Will be returned in case system configuration prevent the command from running. 1-3: Errors only effecting one or more EC. 10-11: Fatal error, no EC was disconnected.",
