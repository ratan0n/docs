  "text": "Workflows consist of software agents, each providing specific functionality, that is linked into automated data flows of virtually any complexity. An intuitive and powerful drag-and-drop management user interface covers all aspects of workflow life-cycle management. Using the workflow concept, interface and processing agents can be configured, deployed, and maintained in a modular way. Workflows may also be inter-linked into scenarios of virtually any complexity, where the output of one workflow is the input of another. Workflow hierarchies can thus be defined, from technology-specific collection flows to convergent service-specific flows for downstream systems. Once configured, workflows are automatically distributed on designated servers that are part of an deployment and executed in accordance with defined scheduling criteria. High availability capabilities ensure that real-time workflows are executing at all times. Batch mode workflows can be configured to execute at period intervals. Execution plans can be defined to ensure workflow execution according to internal strategies and processes.",
