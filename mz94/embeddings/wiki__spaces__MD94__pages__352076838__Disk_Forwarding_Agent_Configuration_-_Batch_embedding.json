  "text": "You open the Disk forwarding agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration. To open the Disk collection agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add agent and select Disk from the Forwarding tab of the Agent Selection dialog. Disk Tab Open Disk forwarding agent configuration - Disk tab Setting Description Setting Description Input Type The agent can act on two input types. Depending on which one the agent is configured to work with, the behavior will differ. The default input type is bytearray, that is the agent expects bytearrays. If nothing else is stated the documentation refer to input of bytearray. If the input type is MultForwardingUDR , the behavior is different. For further information about the agent's behavior in MultiForwardingUDR input, see Disk Forwarding MultiForwardingUDR Input - Batch . Directory Enter the absolute pathname of the target directory on the local file system of the EC, where the forwarded files will be stored. The files will be temporarily stored in the automatically created subdirectory DR_TMP_DIR , in the target directory. When an End Batch message is received, the files are moved from the subdirectory to the target directory. Note! When the File already exists! error is thrown during a workflow execution, the temporary file created in the DR_TMP_DIR directory will not be removed. If changing to a new path, you will need to remove the temporary file created in the previous path's DR_TMP_DIR before running the workflow with the new directory. Create Directory Check to create the directory, or the directory structure, of the path that you specify in Directory. Note! The directories are created when the workflow is executed. Compression Select the compression type of the target files. Determines if the agent will compress the files or not. No Compression - agent does not compress the files. Default setting. Gzip - agent compresses the files using gzip. Note! No extra extension will be appended to the target filenames, even if compression is selected. The configuration of the filenames is managed in the Filename Template tab only. Command If a Command is supplied, it will be executed on each successfully closed temporary file, using the parameter values declared in Arguments. Refer to the section, Commands in Desktop User's Guide . Note! At this point the temporary file is created and closed, however the final filename has not yet been created. The entered Command has to exist in the execution environment, either including an absolute path, or to be found in the PATH for the execution environment. Arguments This field is optional. Each entered parameter value has to be separated from the preceding value with a space. The temporary filename is inserted as the second last parameter, and the final filename is inserted as the last parameter, automatically. This means that if, for instance, no parameter is given in the field, the arguments will be as follows: $1=<temporary_filename> $2=<final_filename> If three parameters are given in the field Arguments, the arguments are set as: $1=<parameter_value_#1> $2=<parameter_value_#2> $3=<parameter_value_#3> $4=<temporary_filename> $5=<final_filename> Produce Empty Files If enabled, files will be produced although containing no data.
