  "text": "An object router exists on Collection and Processing agents. In case several outgoing routes are defined, the object router manages them all. The router defines consume methods for DRUDR and byte[]. In case an agent will route-specific data on different routes, the consume method that takes a route index must be used. The route index can be resolved using the getRouteIndex method that takes the name of the route as argument. The object router also keeps internal counters of how many UDRs/bytes that have been forwarded. These may be used to collect statistics within the agent and are also available as MIM values.",
