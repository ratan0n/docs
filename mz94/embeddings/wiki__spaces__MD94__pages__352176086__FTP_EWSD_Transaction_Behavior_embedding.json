Emits The agent emits commands that change the state of the file that is currently being processed. Command Description Begin Batch Invoked right before the first byte of each file is collected by a workflow. End Batch Invoked right after the last byte of each file is collected by a workflow. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents and based on them generates a state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch to ECS. Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior, defined for a workflow, is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will not receive the last Cancel Batch message. In such a case, an ECS is not involved, and the established copy is not deleted.",
