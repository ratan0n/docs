Select the UDRs of interest, or none (this way all UDRs within the file are considered), and click Bulk Edit... Open Setting Description Setting Description UDR Type If you have selected UDRs in the UDR File Editor and opened Bulk Edit, the UDR type of the selected UDRs is displayed in this field. If you want to change to another UDR type, click the Browse... button to open the UDR Internal Format Browser where you can select a different UDR type. Filter UDRs and assign UDR fields In this field, you can write custom APL code to edit all selected UDRs. Close Click this button to close the Bulk Edit file - data dialog. Apply Changes Click to apply the changes defined in the APL code. Note! When bulk editing UDRs, the changes of the UDRs are not traceable. All selected UDRs are updated, although their values may not change. Auto Edit Mode This mode allows the editing of bulk of UDRs using matchers and assignments. Note! This mode is available in Legacy Desktop only. Setting Description Setting Description Matchers Defines the UDRs targeted for update. For further information about adding Matchers, see the section below, Add Matcher . Join Style Indicates if All or Any will apply to the conditions in the Matchers list Field Specifies the fields to examine when defining target UDRs Matcher Configuration The expression to apply when matching. Ericsson IOG/IN formats: (see External - Ericsson IOG/IN Records ). This special format type is described through the inw variant of the external block.

Field Fields to edit Assignment Configuration The new value of the field Add Matcher A Matcher is added by selecting Add in the Matchers section. The fields are explained in the table below: Setting Description Setting Description UDR Field List of available fields to use as matchers. Depending on the field type, the Matcher Type list updates to display valid choices. Matcher Type Defines the check criterion for the field. The content of the list varies depending on the field type. Supported types and some of their possible matchers are: Alphanumeric (string, char) - Contains, Begins With, Matches RegExp, etc. Date - Equals, Before, After etc. Numeric - Not Equals, Greater Than, Less Than etc. Bytearray - Is null, Not null, Length equals, Length not equals, Byte at position equals Parameter Some field types can consist of several parts. For instance, date types can contain separate values for year, month, and day. Regular numeric/alphanumeric fields will have Value stated. Is APL Indicates the possibility of entering variable values for the validation field via the use of APL code in the Value column. This feature makes it possible to refer to other fields within the same UDR (as well as call to APL functions) during processing. In the image below, the P155_PackageLength field is of type int . If Is APL is disabled, the Matcher Configuration is interpreted as an int instead of a function. Value The value of the field. By default, a constant is entered. If Is APL is selected, APL syntax can be used to create a variable definition.",
