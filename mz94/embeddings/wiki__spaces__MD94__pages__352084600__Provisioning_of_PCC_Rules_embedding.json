  "text": "Provisioning of rules is either done via a batch workflow, using APL functions, via a REST web interface, or via the Web UI. The APL functions are described in APL - PCC Rules Provisioning Plugin, the REST web service in REST HTTP Interface, and the Web UI. Provisioning of rules always targets a specific, internally predefined, area. Changes in one area are not reflected in the other. There are two different areas, TEST and PROD, that the provisioning can target. A typical way of using the areas would be to provision rules data to the TEST area and, when considered ready, copy the content of the TEST area to the PROD area, where a workflow can access them. Using two different areas - one for testing and one for production - makes it possible to test the rules before moving them into production. This chapter includes the following sections: APL - PCC Rules Provisioning Plugin REST HTTP Interface Provisioning PCC Rules in Desktop",
