It is constructed as a set of capabilities to facilitate charging for telecom network connectivity services delivered by the CSP using 5G stand-alone networks (5GC), characterized by, and limited to: Interoperability with the 5G Service Based Architecture The ability to define and terminate the Nchf interface, via reference points N28 (SMF <-> CHF) and N40 (PCF <-> CHF) The ability to register as a CHF with the Network Repository Function (NRF) via the Nnrf API Interoperability with Charging Domain components Integration and call-flow orchestration between the CHF, Account Balance Management Function (ABMF), and Rating Function (RF) via a supported interface Interoperability with the Charging Gateway Function (CGF) via a supported interface, in order to facilitate CDR generation and data flow to downstream Billing Domain (BD) systems Commercial Models and purposes Direct B2C connectivity Direct B2B connectivity Telecom network inbound roaming Telecom network outbound roaming This Right to Use (RTU) grants the licensee the right to use DigitalRoutes MediationZone software in accordance with this definition.",
