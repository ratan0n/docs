The data models are defined in xml format, and then packed into an mzp that is committed into the system. Then they will be available from the regular interfaces for provisioning. To create a PCC Extension data model: Create XML files describing your data model and store it in the /mediationzone/packages/pcrf/src/devkit_tools/example/model/ folder. Go to the /mediationzone/packages/pcrf/src/devkit_tools/example/ folder and run the generate.sh script to generate your *.jar file. $./generate.sh A /build directory will be created with all the required classes and resources. A *.jar file will be created and placed in a new sub directory called /build. There is an example of a 5G PCF Rules model included in the Development Toolkit, see Development Toolkit User's Guide .
