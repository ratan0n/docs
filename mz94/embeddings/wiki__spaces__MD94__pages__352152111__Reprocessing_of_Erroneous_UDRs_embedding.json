  "text": "Reprocessing Groups are used to collect records from ECS into a workflow. It is possible to do automatic association of a Reprocessing Group to an error code when the UDR with the error code is sent to ECS. If not done automatically, this assignment is done manually usually after the corrective action is taken so that the record can be processed to completion in a workflow. Open An example of a reprocessing workflow using ECS The example above shows a reprocessing workflow that collects from ECS, applies correction logic and then reintroduces corrected data to the appropriate streams or sends it to ECS again if the UDRs cannot be corrected. In the example there is a node called Correction_Analysis where APL can be configured to also make corrections to the records prior to further processing. If the UDRs are not corrected in ECS or prior to the node Validation, the UDR will fail validation and be returned to ECS. Records that now pass the validation will continue processing through to workflow completion. Records that are reprocessed are assigned the Reprocessing State of Reprocessed (as opposed to New when the records enter ECS). MediationZone provides a configurable task within the Task Manager that can be scheduled to automatically clean these reprocessed records out of ECS.",
