  "text": "ECS Error Codes can be defined in ECS and associated with UDRs and batches. A Reprocessing Group can also be linked to an Error Code so that when an entity is inserted into the ECS, it is automatically available for collection by the ECS Collection agent. The system includes two predefined error codes, AGGR_UNMATCHED_UDR and DUPLICATE_UDR . The Aggregation and Duplicate UDR Detection agents automatically set these codes when the corresponding error conditions are detected. Apart from the two predefined error codes, the rest of the error codes are defined by the user. In addition to ECS Inspector, error codes are also utilized in ECS Statistics and ECS Statistics Event . Note! Error Codes are also used in Data Veracity. For more information about Data Veracity and how Error Codes are used in Data Veracity, see Data Veracity . Note! Multiple error codes can be associated with a single UDR, impacting the ECS Statistics output. This section has the following subsections: ECS - Creating an Error Code ECS - Searching for an Error Code ECS - Editing an Error Code ECS - Deleting an Error Code ECS - Attaching Information to an Error Code",
