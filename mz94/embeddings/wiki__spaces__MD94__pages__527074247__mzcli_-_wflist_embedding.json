If you use the command without any options, all workflows will be listed. Options Option Description Option Description [-invalid] Lists all invalid workflows. [-valid] Lists all valid workflows. [-active] Lists all active workflows. [-inactive] Lists all inactive workflows. [ -not-member-of-wfgroup ] Lists all the workflows that are not included in a workflow group. [-long] Lists the workflow state and information about the latest start (aborted or not started). If the workflow is running long reveals how long it has been running. long will also display the current throughput. [-long [ -activationMode]] Lists the workflow state and information about the latest start as well as the workflow's activation mode. If the workflow is enabled it will be shown as ENABLED. [-loop [ N ]] Sets a loop mode that runs the wflist command forever every N seconds (N is by default set to 10) To terminate loop use Ctrl-C. Note! When combining [-active] and [-long], the Execution Context and the execution time for the workflow will be listed.
