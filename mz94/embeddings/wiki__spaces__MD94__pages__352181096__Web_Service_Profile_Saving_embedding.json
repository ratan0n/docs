  "text": "When saving a WS profile, the profile will be saved in the folder selected in the Save As dialog with the name entered. When the WS profile is saved, several UDRs are generated. They are saved in a folder structure based on the WS profile name. Therefore, it is important to make sure the WS profile is saved in the appropriate place with a suitable name. The UDR's folder structure is not automatically adjusted and saved along with the WS profile if a user decides to rename or move the profile to a new folder. Note! The name of the folder to which you save the WS profile, and the WS profile name cannot include a dash, \"-\". A dash in the folder or profile name invalidates the WS profile. Note! If possible, avoid renaming . If you must rename the profile, it must be saved again in its new location, regenerating the UDRs there. For further information about viewing the UDR type structure, see Web Service UDR Type Folder Structure .",
