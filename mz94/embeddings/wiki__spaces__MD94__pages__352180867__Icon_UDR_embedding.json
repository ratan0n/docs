Alternatively, you can use the Line Awesome library, which is bundled in MediationZone and does not require internet access.

The icon specified in the stackedIconName field will appear on top and be slightly larger than the one below. Open A stacked icon To create the stacked icon shown above, enter the following code: Icon clearSearchIcon = udrCreate(Icon); clearSearchIcon.iconName = \"fa-magnifying-glass\"; clearSearchIcon.iconStyle = clearSearchIcon.SOLID; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconName = \"fa-ban\"; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconStyle = clearSearchIcon.SOLID; clearSearchIcon.stackedIconColor = \"tomato\"; The following fields are included in the Icon UDR : Field Description Field Description attributes (map<string,string>) This field may contain extra attributes to be added. cssClasses (list<string>) This field may contain a list of extra values added to class attribute.
