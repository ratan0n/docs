  "text": "Both the JMS collection agent and JMS request agent send and receive JMSCycle types. For further information, see the image below. The UDR Browser shows the JMSCycle UDR type. The Request and Response fields are of the type any . During runtime these fields are converted to a JMS message according to the following rule: APL Type JMS Message Type APL Type JMS Message Type String TextMessage byte[] BytesMessage Note! If a value's type is not supported, a system log message is generated and the UDR is ignored. You can view the JMSCycle UDR from the UDR Internal Format Browser . To access the UDR Internal Format Browser : Open an APL agent configuration. Right-click on the code editor and select UDR Assistance... UDR Internal Format Browser - JMSCycle UDR Field Description Field Description Context (any) This field contains information about the context in which the operation is being invoked when needed. GetResponse (boolean) This field is set as true in a JMS Request workflow to indicate that a reply is expected, or as false to indicate that a reply is not expected. Note! This field only applies in a workflow that includes a JMS Request agent. HasReplyToDestination (boolean) This field is used by the workflow to determine whether an answer can be routed back or not. Note! This field only applies in a workflow that includes a JMS Collector agent. Request (any) This field contains the request. For valid Request types see the table above. RequestProperties (map<string,any>) Request message properties. For further information see JMS Message Properties below. Response (any) This field contains the response. For valid Response types see the table above. ResponseProperties (map<string,any>) Response message properties. For further information, see the section below, JMS Message Properties. Status(int) The value informs you about the message status: 0 (zero) : There has not been any attempt to send the message (UDR) yet. 10 : The message has been successfully sent and an answer has been received. 20 : The message response had not been received within the timeout limitations. 30 : Failed to send the message. 31 : Failed to send the message due to a broken JMS connection. 32 : Failed to send the message to the server due to slow or overloaded JMS server. 40 : A response with an unknown correlation ID was sent to the request agent. Note! This field only applies in a workflow that includes a JMS Request agent. If the GetResponse is set to False , only status codes 30 , 31 and 32 are applicable. OriginalData(bytearray) This field contains the original data in bytearray format. JMS Message Properties The JMS Message properties can be accessed in the UDR using the RequestProperties and the ResponseProperties fields. When the message is received, these fields are mapped to those of the output message, before the message is sent to the JMS server. The value types are checked by the agent when sent. If an invalid value type is found, an error is generated. The supported property values are: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, or string.",
