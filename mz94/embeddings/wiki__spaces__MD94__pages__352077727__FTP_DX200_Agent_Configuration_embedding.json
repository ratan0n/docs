  "text": "You open the FTP DX200 collection agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration. To open the configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add agent and select FTP DX200 from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. The dialog contains three tabs; Switch , Advanced, and TTSCOF Settings . Switch Tab The Switch tab includes configuration settings that are related to the remote host and the directory where the control files are located. On this tab you specify from which VDS device the control files are retrieved, and the time zone location of the VDS device. Open FTP DX200 collection agent configuration - Switch tab with FTP Open FTP DX200 collection agent configuration - Switch tab with SFTP Setting Description Setting Description Host Name Enter the name of the Host or the IP address of the switch that is to be connected. Transfer Protocol Choose transfer protocol. Authenticate With Choice of authentication mechanism. Both password and private key authentication are supported. When you select Private Key , a Select... button will appear, which opens a window where the private key may be inserted. If the private key is protected by a passphrase, the passphrase must be provided as well. For further information about private keys, see Authentication in 9.31.2 FTP DX200 Agent Preparations . User Name Enter the name of the user from whose account on the remote Switch the FTP session is created. Password Enter the user password. Root Directory Enter the physical path of the source directory on the remote Host, where the control files are saved. Path To Data Files Enter the path to the directory where the data files are located, if they are not located in the Root Directory, in this field. Switch Time Zone Select the time zone location. Timezone is used when updating the transaction control file. VDS Device No. Enter the network element device from where the control files are retrieved. Advanced Tab The Advanced tab includes configuration settings that are related to more specific use of the FTP service. Open FTP DX200 collection agent configuration - Advanced tab Setting Description Setting Description Prefix Enter the data files name prefix Number Positions Select the length of the number-part in the data file name as follows: 01 for a two digit number 001 for a three digit number 0001 for a four digit number For example: If you select 0001, data file number 99 will include the following four digits: 0099 . Ends With VDS Device No. Select this check box to create data file names that end with VDS device No. Server Port Enter the port number for the server to connect to, on the remote Switch . Note! Make sure to update the Server Port when changing the Transfer Protocol . Number Of Retries Enter the number of attempts to reconnect after temporary communication errors. Retry Interval (ms) Enter the time interval, in milliseconds, between connection attempts. Force Delay (s) Select this option to force a delay (in seconds) between the TTTCOF write and the TTSCOF read. The maximum value is 3600. The default value is 0. Decompress Files Data files are decompressed by default. If you want the data files to be compressed, deselect this check box. Local Data Port Enter the local port number that the agent will listen to for incoming data connections. This port will be used when communication is established in Active Mode. If the default value, zero, is not changed, the FTP server will negotiate about the port the data communication will be established on. Active Mode (PORT) Select this check box to set the FTP connection mode to ACTIVE. Otherwise, the mode is PASSIVE. Transfer Type Select either Binary or ASCII transfer of the data files. Note! Setting Transfer Type to the wrong type might corrupt the transferred data files. FTP Command Trace Select this check box to generate a printout of the FTP commands and responses. This printout is logged in the Event Area of the Workflow Monitor. Use this option only to trace communication problems, as workflow performance might deteriorate. Accept New Host Keys Select this check box if you want the existing host key to be overwritten when the host is represented with a new key. The default behavior is to abort when the key mismatches. Warning! Selecting this option causes a security risk since new keys are accepted regardless of if they belong to another machine. TTSCOF Settings Tab Open FTP DX200 collection agent configuration - TTSCOF Settings tab The TTSCOF Settings tab includes configuration settings that allows you to adjust the default settings for the FTP DX200 agent Setting Description Setting Description Collect when file is present on only one WDU With this setting you can select to allow files to be collected, even though they are only present on one WDU. This may be useful if one of the WDUs cannot be reached for some reason. Default is No, which means that files will only be collected if they are present on both WDUs. Note! WDU is short for Winchester Drive Unit, and each VDS (Virtual Data Storage) has two WDUs. WDU0 Path In this field you can specify the path to WDU0. This setting is optional. WDU1 Path In this field you can specify the path to WDU1. This setting is optional. Select default collection WDU Select the WDU you want to use as default in this list. WDU 1 is default. Collect files with bit 5 In this list you can select if you only want to collect files where bit 5 IS NOT set ( Must not be set ), or where bit 5 IS set ( Must be set ), or if you always want to collect files regardless of whether bit 5 is set or not ( May be set ). Collect files with bit 6 In this list you can select if you only want to collect files where bit 6 IS NOT set ( Must not be set ), or where bit 6 IS set ( Must be set ), or if you always want to collect files regardless of whether bit 6 is set or not ( May be set ). Collect files with bit 7 In this list you can select if you only want to collect files where bit 7 IS NOT set ( Must not be set ), or where bit 7 IS set ( Must be set ), or if you always want to collect files regardless of whether bit 7 is set or not ( May be set ).",
