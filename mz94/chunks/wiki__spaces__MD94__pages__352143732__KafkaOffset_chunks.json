It only applies if you have selected the Start At Request option in the Kafka Real-Time Collection Agent Configuration . The Kafka Collection agent waits for the kafkaOffset UDR before starting to consume data. The offset information can be persisted and tracked by, for example, using the Aggregation agent, or forwarding to an external database. Field Description offsets (map<string,map<int,long>>) This field is populated with offset information. The string identifies the topic. As offsets in Kafka are unique per partition, this maps partition identifiers (int) to offsets (long).",
