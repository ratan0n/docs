    "text": "This section describes the JMS agents. The agents are collection and processing agents for real-time workflow configurations. The JMS agents enable MediationZone to communicate with other JMS application components. Following the JMS 1.1 specification, the agents look up the configured ConnectionFactory and Destination objects using JNDI. Therefore, it is required that a JNDI server is configured and can be accessed by the agents. The following JMS vendors are currently supported: Weblogic SonicMQ ActiveMQ JBossMQ HornetQ Solace Note! Solace has a known limitation when the JMS processing agent and Solace VMR server are temporarily disrupted. When the agent successfully reconnects, it freezes when forwarding the next JMS message via a Solace JMS API. The issue is observed when using Solace JMS APIs lib version 10.1.1.
