For information about the general transaction behavior, see the section Transactions in Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Setting Description Setting Description Begin Batch Emitted before the first byte of the collected file(s) are fed into a workflow. End Batch Emitted after the last byte of last collected file has been fed into the system. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents, and based on them generates a state change of the file currently processed. Setting Description Setting Description Cancel Batch If Never Abort has been configured on workflow level, in Workflow Properties, and a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent sends the batch (the UDRs that have been successfully read) to ECS. The batch will be closed and moved immediately, regardless of the criteria defined in the Merge Definition and the Workflow will continue executing. If, on the other hand, the Cancel Batch behavior has been configured to abort the workflow (default), the batch will not be sent to ECS. For further information please refer to Workflow Properties . Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on workflow level is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will never receive the last Cancel Batch message. In this situation ECS will not be involved, and the file will not be moved.",
