    "text": "This document describes the GTP' LGU ReCollection agent. This is a collection agent for real-time workflow configurations. The GTP' LGU ReCollection agent is useful for retrieving specific sets of charging data that are already collected by the GTP' agent, GTP' LGU Collection agent, or data that has been found missing. The agent receives UDRs that contain sequence numbers of GTP' Data Record Packages from the workflow. The agent uses these UDRs to initiate an FTP transfer of the specified packages from a network element, such as a GSN node. Open Interaction Scenario The diagram below illustrates the data transfer between a workflow and a network element. Open The agent waits for a GTPRecollectionRequestUDR from the workflow. The UDR contains a list of sequence numbers, identifying packages that are to be transferred. The agent adds a request for each received UDR in an internal queue. The GTP' LGU ReCollection agent uses UDP to send the queued requests to the connected network element one by one. The network element transfers the requested data via FTP. When the FTP transfer is complete, the network element sends an answer to the GTP' LGU ReCollection agent via UDP. This step is repeated for each request in the queue. When the GTP' LGU ReCollection agent has received an answer for a request, it emits a GTPRecollectionResponseUDR that can be routed back to the workflow.
