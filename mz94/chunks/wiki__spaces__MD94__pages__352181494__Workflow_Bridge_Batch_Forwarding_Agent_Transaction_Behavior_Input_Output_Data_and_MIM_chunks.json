    "text": "Transaction Behavior Emits The agent sends out data in the ConsumeCycleUDR and the WorkflowState UDRs. Retrieves The agent acquires ConsumeCycleUDR s and WorkflowState UDRs from the collection workflow. Input/Output Data The agent consumes bytearray types and any UDRs, as configured in the profile. Please refer to Workflow Bridge Profile for more information. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Number of collectors Number of collectors is of the int type and indicates the number of collectors configured in the Workflow Bridge profile. Forwarding Queue Size Forwarding Queue Size is of the int type and contains the value of forwardingQueueSize , which is defined under the Advanced tab in the Workflow Bridge profile configuration. Forwarding Queue Utilization Forwarding Queue Utilization is of the any type and contains a hashmap of the number of UDRs that are currently queued in the forwarding workflows. The loadId values of the collecting workflows are used as keys to the hashmap. If loadId is not used, the key will have the value 1. The hashmap is periodically refreshed and cached in order to prevent impact on performance when the MIM value is repeatedly queried. Example - Use of Forwarding Queue Utilization in APL consume { map<int, int> queueMap = (map<int, int>) mimGet(\"Workflow_Bridge_1\", \"Forwarding Queue Utilization\"); int loadId = 1; int queueSize = mapGet(queueMap, loadId); debug(\"Queue Utilization: \" + queueSize); wfb.ConsumeCycleUDR ccUDR = udrCreate(wfb.ConsumeCycleUDR); ccUDR.Data = input; udrRoute(ccUDR); } Accesses The agent does not access any MIM resources.",
