Resetting Configurations Run the following command to rollback changes that cannot be validated. $ mzsh topo reset Note! When you run this command, the directory structure of the STR will be recreated and any existing directory- or file handles will be stale. For instance, if you run the command from a shell and the current directory is in the STR, i e under $MZ_HOME/common/config/cell/default , it will appear empty. Activating Configurations Run the following command to validate configurations in the master registry and propagate changes to the active registry. $ mzsh topo activate Note! This command is only required when you use the mzsh topo command with the flag --no-activation, or after manual edits in the STR. When you run this command, the directory structure of the STR will be recreated and any existing directory- or file handles will be stale. For instance, if you run the command from a shell and the current directory is in the STR, i e under $MZ_HOME/common/config/cell/default , it will appear empty. Hint! When you run mzsh topo activate with the -v flag after manual edits, the printout on stdout contains mzsh topo set commands that correspond to the staged changes in the file pico.conf .
