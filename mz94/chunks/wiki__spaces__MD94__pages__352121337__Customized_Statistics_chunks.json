The captured statistical data is recorded in user defined database tables. For the creation of the customized reports, we rely on external reporting tools. Alternatively, a workflow can be used to collect the data, process it according to requirements, and forward it as an XML or ASCII file. Since there are different needs for different kind of reports, MediationZone provides for comprehensive support to capture and store statistical information. Statistical data should be exported to a separate server if a lot of data reports are to be generated.",
