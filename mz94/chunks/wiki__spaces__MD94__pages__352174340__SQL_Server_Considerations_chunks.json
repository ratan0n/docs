The column reserved for the Transaction ID must be of type bigint . Columns of type UNIQUEIDENTIFIER must be set with a function. Hence, map it to NULL in the agent. Columns with an IDENTITY set must be mapped to NULL in the agent. Note! For MS SQL, the column type timestamp is not supported in tables accessed by MediationZone. Use column type datetime instead. See System Administrator's Guide for information about time zone settings.",
