The Python Connector agent is a real-time collection agent that you use to connect MediationZone to an external exploration tool. The Python collection agent can collect data from any source supported by Python. The Python collection, processing, and Python Connector agents can use the Python code added to Python Module configurations. Each of the agents, with the exception of the Python Connector agent, runs a Python process. The Python agents support Python 3.
