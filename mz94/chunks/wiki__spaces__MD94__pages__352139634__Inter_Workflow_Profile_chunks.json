    "text": "The Inter Workflow profile enables you to configure the storage server that the Inter Workflow forwarding and collection agents use for communication. It is safe to accumulate a lot of data in the storage server directory. When the initial set of directories has been populated with a predefined number of files, new directories are automatically created to avoid problems with file system performance. You can configure the Inter Workflow profile for the following storage types: Database Storage File Storage The Inter Workflow profile is loaded when you start a workflow that depends on it. Changes to the profile become effective when you restart the workflow. Note! Files collected by the Inter Workflow agent depend on and are connected with the Inter Workflow profile in use. If an Inter Workflow profile is imported to the system, files left in the storage connected to the old profile will be unreachable. Configuration To create a new Inter Workflow profile configuration, click the Configuration  New Configuration in the upper part of the Desktop window, and then select Inter Workflow Profile from the menu. The Inter Workflow profile configuration contains the following settings: Open Open The contents of the menus in the menu bar may change depending on which configuration type is opened. The Inter Workflow profile uses the standard menu items and buttons that are visible for all configurations, and these are described in Configuration View The External References button in the menu bar is specific to Inter Workflow profile configurations. Button Description Button Description Open Select this menu item to enable External References in an agent profile field. For further information, see the section Enabling External References in an Agent Profile Field in External Reference Profile . The Inter Workflow profile configuration contains the following settings: Setting Description Available when.. Setting Description Available when.. Storage Type From the drop-down list, select either File Storage or Database Storage. Using Database Storage means that a database will be used as storage instead of the EC file system. When choosing this option, several new fields will be displayed. Always available Database Profile Click Browse to select the Database Profile you want to use for the Inter Workflow Profile. Note! Currently, the SQL storage only supports PostgreSQL, SAP HANA, and Oracle databases. Database storage is configured Show SQL Statement When you select Database Profile , this button will print the SQL statements needed to create the tables and indexes required for the Inter Workflow Profile. You can copy and paste this into your database management software. Note! You will have to copy the SQL script generated in the text box to create the PostgreSQL, SAP HANA, or Oracle tables on their own in the database listed in the Database profile. The Inter Workflow profile will not automatically create the tables for you. Database storage is configured Copy to Clipboard This button will copy the text in the text area below, which was generated by the Show SQL Statement button, to the clipboard on your computer. Database Storage is configured Root Directory The directory's absolute pathname on the storage handler where the temporary files will be placed. If this field is greyed out with a stated directory, it means that the directory path has been hard-coded using the mz.present.interwf.storage.path property. This property is set to false by default. Example - Using the mz.preset.interwf.storage.path property To enable the property and state the directory to be used: mzsh topo set val:common.mz.preset.interwf.storage.path '/mydirectory/iwf' To disable the property: mzsh topo unset val:common.mz.preset.interwf.storage.path For further information about all available system properties, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/Qev8F . File Storage is configured Storage Host From the drop-down list, select either Automatic or an activated EC group. Using Automatic means that the storage will use the EC Group where the first workflow accessing this profile is started. Following workflows using the same profile will use the same EC Group for storage until the first workflow accessing the profile is stopped. The EC Group where the next workflow accessing this profile is started will then be used for storage. The location of the storage will therefore vary depending on the start order of the workflows. Example - Automatic storage host Below is an example of a scenario where Automatic is used as a storage host with the following setup: Workflow 1 is running on EC Group 1 with the Inter Workflow Forwarding agent Workflow 2 is running on EC Group 2 with the Inter Workflow Collection agent Workflow 2 is started. EC Group 2 is used for storage Workflow 1 is started. EC Group 2 is still used for storage. Workflow 1 is stopped. EC Group 2 is still used for storage. Workflow 2 is stopped. No EC Group is used for storage. Workflow 1 is started. EC Group 1 is used for storage. Note! The workflow must be running on the same EC as its storage resides. If the storage is configured to be Automatic, its corresponding directory must be a shared file system between all the EC Groups. Always available Max Bytes An optional parameter stating the limit of the space consumed by the files stored in the Root Directory or Database. If the limit is reached, any Inter Workflow forwarding agent using this profile will abort. Always available Max Batches An optional parameter stating the maximum number of batches stored in the Root Directory or Database. If the limit is reached, any Inter Workflow forwarding agent using this profile will abort. Always available Compress intermediate data Select this checkbox if you want to compress the data sent between the Inter Workflow agents. The data will be compressed into *.gzip format with compression level 5. Always available Named MIMs A list of user-defined MIM names with no values assigned. They are populated with existing MIM values from the Inter Workflow forwarding agent. This way, MIMs from the forwarding workflow can be passed on to the collecting workflow. Always available",
