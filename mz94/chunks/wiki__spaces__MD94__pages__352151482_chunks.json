    "text": "To produce a full online backup of the Platform databases when running Derby, use the following mzsh command: mzsh mzadmin/<password> derbybackup <backup directory> To restore the database: Shut down MediationZone. Move all directories and files from the backup directory to the Derby restore directory. Use the following command to retrieve the restore directory: mzsh topo get --format data-only topo://container:<container name>/pico:platform/val:config.properties.derby.restore.path Startup MediationZone. After a restore has been performed, the directory defined in derby.restore.path will be renamed upon the next startup, in order to prevent another restore from being made. The new name consists of the old name with the _USED suffix attached. The startup procedure also creates an entry in the System Log, showing the outcome of the restore. Note! In the event where the derby data was not restored, the restoration process can be repeated again by either removing the _USED suffix from the directory name and its content, or repeating the steps above again. Hint! One way of performing regular backups is to create a script that runs the derbybackup command and includes a date as part of the directory name. The script may be called at a regular interval, for instance, once a day, by adding and scheduling a script executor in a Task Workflow in the Workflow Editor.",
