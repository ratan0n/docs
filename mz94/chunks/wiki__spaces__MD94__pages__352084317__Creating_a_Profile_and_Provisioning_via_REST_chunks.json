For further information, see KPI Management - External Software . You provision a service model by sending a single POST method request. This will create a new KPI profile configuration or update an existing one. The request must contain all the required objects in a JSON representation of the data model. You can retrieve the configuration by using the GET method. Basic authentication is used and you must pass user credentials for each REST call. POST Follow this procedure to provision a service model: Stop all KPI Management workflows. Use the HTTP POST method to provision the model. You must specify the name of the KPI profile that will contain the service model using the config parameter. If the specified KPI profile does not exist, it will be created automatically. The hostname and port in the URL should match the properties in the kpi-model service configuration. If the hostname and port are not specified in the service configuration localhost:8095 will be used. Example - POST with curl command $ curl -X POST -T \"example.json\" http://username:passw@myhostname:8095/api/v1/kpi/model?config=<model name> The model is now ready for deployment. GET Use HTTP GET to retrieve a provisioned service model. You must specify the name of the KPI profile that contains the service model using the config parameter. Example - GET with curl command $ curl http://username:passw@myhostname:8095/api/v1/kpi/model?config=KPI.model1",
