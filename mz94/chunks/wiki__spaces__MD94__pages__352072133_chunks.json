The following command session sets up the directory structure and installs all the software. The release content directory is the working directory for the installation. To install the software: Enter the release content directory : $ cd ./<staging directory>/<release content directory> Pre-installation validations are performed to verify the environment and configuration, ensuring a seamless installation experience. The following is validated: install.xml parameters mzadmin password db owner password db parameters check that new version is not older than installed version To perform validation without starting the installation, run the following command: $ ./setup.sh install -validate-only Run the following command to initiate the installation process. $ ./setup.sh install If validation fails but you choose to proceed, you can run the following command. $ ./setup.sh install -skip-validate Caution! You can choose to skip validation, but be aware that this bypasses checks for potential issues in your environment and configuration. If there are undetected problems, the installation may fail or cause unexpected behavior. Proceed with caution and ensure you have backups before continuing. If the Platform was running during the installation, the Execution Container is registered in STR. You can register the container manually by using the command: $ mzsh topo register The installation of the Execution Container is now complete.",
