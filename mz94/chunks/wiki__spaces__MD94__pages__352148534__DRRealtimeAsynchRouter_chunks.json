The interface also defines a notification method to be called when the backlog of unprocessed records grows over a certain limit, as defined in the Workflow Preferences as Limit. The notification can also be called before the limit is reached. For information regarding how to control this, see the section DRRealtimeServerEnv in Environment Interfaces . An important limitation is that an agent, implementing this interface, is not allowed to route raw data to other agents. Only records are allowed. If raw data needs to be routed, encapsulate it in a record.",
