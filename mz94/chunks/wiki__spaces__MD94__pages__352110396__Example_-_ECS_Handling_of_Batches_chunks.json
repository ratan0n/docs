    "text": "When a batch workflow triggers a cancelBatch , the error batch will be sent to ECS, provided that ECS is selected for the Error Batch Type field in Workflow Properties > Error tab. See the Workflow Properties Error Tab . A cancelBatch scenario can happen when it is emitted by some of the agents used in batch workflows, such as the Duplicate Batch agent (that can be used to detect duplicate files), or via the cancelBatch() APL function. For information about the cancelBatch state, see Workflow Execution State . This section illustrates an example where a workflow encounters a cancelBatch scenario and subsequently routes the error batch to ECS . In a typical batch file processing workflow, you can implement validation logic to ensure the file meets predefined criteria. Scenarios that can cause a batch to be considered invalid and trigger a cancelBatch may include being identified as a duplicate, missing a footer, containing a footer in an invalid format, or failing to decode due to file corruption. A batch workflow using the ECS Collection agent can be configured to retrieve error batches by referencing the appropriate Reprocessing Group . For error batch data, ECS Collection agent produces bytearray data can be output into new files, which can subsequently be reprocessed with your workflow. ECS Collection agent Saved Filter is not applicable when collecting error batches. This section has the following subsections: ECS Forwarding Workflow (Batch) ECS Collection Workflow (Batch)",
