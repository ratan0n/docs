    "text": "The KPI Cluster In and KPI Cluster Out agents are real-time processing agents that deliver KPIs based on the configured service model and the incoming KDR UDRs. The KPI Cluster In agent sends incoming KDR UDRs to a Spark application via a Kafka cluster. The actual KPI calculations are then performed in the Spark Application and the result is passed to a KPI Cluster Out agent, which decodes the bytearray payload from Kafka and delivers KPIAggregatedOutput UDRs. Open KPI Management workflows When the service model is configured to trigger immediate alarms you must configure two separate Kafka Collector agents, one for the kpi-output topic, and another for the kpi-alarm topic. Configuration Open KPI Cluster In configuration Open KPI Cluster Out configuration Setting Description Setting Description Kafka Profile Click Browse to select a predefined Kafka profile. The profile contains the service model configuration. KPI Profile Click Browse to select a predefined KPI profile. The profile contains the service model configuration. Input/Output Data The Input/Output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The KPI Cluster In agent expects KDR UDRs and delivers KafkaUDRs . The KPI Cluster Out agent expects Kafka UDR types and delivers KPIAggregatedOutput UDRs. MIM Publishes MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Model Config This MIM parameter contains the name of the KPI Profile in the agent configuration. Model Config is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Model Version This MIM parameter contains the version of the KPI Profile in the agent configuration. Model Version is of the int type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Accesses This agent does not access any MIM parameters. Agent Message Events Logs pertaining to KPI Management processing are available in Spark. See Logging for more information. Debug Events",
