It contains a flexible implementation of the Diameter base protocol, enabling configuration of any Diameter application on top of MediationZone. MediationZone also has a Diameter client agent to manage Diameter applications when communicating with Diameter servers. SOX Compliance MediationZone has been used to facilitate compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) with regards to the SOX Control Environment process. See SOX Monitoring for more details. Web Services MediationZone has support for any communication over the Web Services protocol. Providing the same flexibly as for Diameter, MediationZone enables deployment of client as well as Web Services interfaces through configuration. Web services definition languages files (WSDL) compliant with WS-I can be imported into MediationZone, which automatically generates corresponding exchange UDRs that are subsequently accessible in a workflow. This support enables MediationZone to provide an EAI/SOA smooth integration path for any back-office or legacy protocol or processing semantics. MediationZone natively supports the Web Services functionality as described below: WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 WSDL 1.1 XML 1.0 SOAP 1.1 over HTTP 1.1 Transport Level Security (HTTPS over SSL) WS-Security 1.1 is partly supported through signature and encryption",
