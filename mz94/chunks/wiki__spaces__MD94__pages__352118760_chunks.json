    "text": "Usage usage: shutdown [ -q ] [ -r<#> ] [ -f ] <running server process> ... This command is used to stop pico instances. Note! This command is valid only for the MZ_HOME owner. If you have specified more than one pico instance, the command will close down the processes in the order specified by the arguments. If the pico instance is an EC, the command will first close down running workflows and then it shuts down the specified running server processes. Each pico instance will be shut down in an orderly fashion, that is, it will do the required cleanup before terminating. The last thing that the pico instance does is to report back to mzsh that it is about to terminate. When this is done mzsh will continue with the next pico instance. In rare occasions the shutdown command is not forceful enough. In these cases, the kill command can work. For further information, see kill . Options The command accepts the following option: Option Description Option Description [-q] Generates less or no information messages. [-r<#>] Number of retries to check for process shutdown. Default: -r20 [-f] Forces workflow stop when shutting down the EC regardless of system configuration This is the default behavior, When the Execution Context property pico.ec.do_graceful_shutdown has been set to false , you can use this option for graceful shutdown of ECs.
