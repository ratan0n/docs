    "text": "The simple workflow below demonstrates how error Batches are retrieved from ECS using the ECS Collection agent, which can collect records based on a specified Reprocessing Group. When a Batch-type Reprocessing Group is selected, the UDR Types option is disabled, and the output data will be in bytearray format. Saved Filter is not applicable for collecting error Batches. The workflow then decodes the collected error batches and outputs them to new batch files. The ECS Collection agent retrieves only Batches whose Reprocessing State is set to New . When collecting error Batches using a Reprocessing Group , the Reprocessing State of the collected Batches will be updated to Reprocessed . Open ECS Collection Agent All error batches conforming to the collection criteria are collected from ECS. If an error batch contains historic UDRs, that is, UDRs belonging to old, not used format definitions, they are automatically converted by default to the latest format. The automatic conversion can be disabled from the Ultra Format Converter. In this case, the workflow aborts and logs an informative message in the System Log.",
