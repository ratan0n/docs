    "text": "The Web Service Provider agent has a great resemblance to a server and allows Web Service requests to be collected and inserted into a workflow. When a request arrives at the Web Service Provider, it will first decode and validate it into a pre-generated UDR type, WSCycle UDR. WSCycleUDR is then routed through the workflow with the param field set to the incoming message. If the client expects a response message, the workflow is responsible for populating the response field with an appropriate answer message (through the udrCreate APL function). The WSCycleUDR must then be routed back to the Web Service Provider agent to transmit the answer. Note! Configurations made in the agent always override settings originating from the WSDL file. The section has the following subsections: Web Service Provider Agent Configuration Web Service Provider Agent Input/Output Data, MIM and Events",
