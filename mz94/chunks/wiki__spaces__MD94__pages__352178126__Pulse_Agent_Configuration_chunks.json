    "text": "You open the Pulse collection agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration. To open the Amazon S3 collection agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type , select Realtime . Click Add agent and select Pulse from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. Interval Tab The Interval tab contains configuration settings related to the interval type and the related time parameters that control how often the pulse UDRs will be generated. Open The Pulse agent configuration dialog - Interval tab Setting Description Ti me Unit Select the time unit that is applicable to the time fields on this tab. Interval Type Select an interval type that corresponds with the desired generation of Pulse UDRs. Fixed - UDRs are generated at a fixed time interval Linear - UDRs are generated at a linearly increasing or decreasing time interval. Gaussian - UDRs are generated according to a Gaussian probability distribution. Poisson - UDRs are generated according to a Poisson process. Single - A single UDR is generated at workflow start. Interval Enter the interval between the pulses according to the specified time unit. Interval is available when the selected Interval Type is Fixed . Start Enter the start interval between pulses. Start is available when the selected Interval Type is Linear . Stop Enter the final interval between pulses. Stop is available when the selected Interval Type is Linear . Rate Enter the value that is incremented or decremented from the interval when a Pulse UDR is generated. Use a positive value to increment and a negative value to decrement. Rate is available when the selected Interval Type is Linear . Central Interval When the selected Interval Type is Gaussian , enter the median interval between Pulse UDRs in the probability distribution. When the selected Interval Type is Poisson , enter 1/(expected number of Pulse UDRs per time unit). Example - Poisson interval type Expected number of Pulse UDRs is five (5) per second. 1/5=0.2 seconds between UDRs Select MILLISECONDS in Time Unit and enter 200 in Central Interval . Central Interval is available when the selected Interval Type is Gaussian or Poisson . Width Enter the standard deviation of the probability distribution. When you use a low value, the intervals tend to be close to the value of the Central Interval . Use a high value to spread the intervals over a wider range. Width is available when the selected Interval Type is Gaussian . Note! The real value of the configured interval length is approximated and should not be used for timing-sensitive tasks. To get the most accurate pulse-delay, use fixed time intervals. Data Tab The Data tab includes settings that control the contents of the Pulse UDRs. Open The Pulse agent configuration dialog - Data tab Setting Description Ra nd om With Range Select this radio button to populate the Sequence field in the Pulse UDRs with a random integer. The range of the values are specified in the Range fields. Sequential Select this radio button to populate the Sequence field in the Pulse UDRs with a value from an infinite sequence starting at 0. The sequence is reset when a workflow is restarted. Sequential With Range Select this radio button to populate the Sequence field in the Pulse UDRs with a value from a finite sequence. The range of the values are specified in the Range fields. The sequence is reset when a workflow is restarted or when the end value is reached. Range Enter the start and end value of the sequence. You can use negative values but the end value must be greater than the start value. Random Data Select this radio button to generate random data in the Data field of the Pulse UDRs. The data is generated when the workflow starts and each UDR will contain the same data. Size Enter the size of the random data and select the byte unit from the drop-down list. Fixed Data Select this radio button to have fixed data in each PulseUDR. Enter the data in the text area that is to be populated in the Data field of the Pulse UDRs.",
