    "text": "Input/Output Data The Input/Output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The agents consume bytearray types. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes MIM Parameter Description Connection Retries This MIM parameter contains the number of re-connections, resulting from connection problems, since the last Workflow activation. Connection Retries is of the integer type and is defined as a batch MIM context type. File Creation Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a time stamp, that indicates when the file has been created. The value originates from the Data Storage Control File and is expressed in local time. File Creation Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. File Retrieval Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a time stamp, that indicates when the file transfer starts. File Retrieval Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Filename This MIM parameter contains the name of the file that is currently being processed, as defined at the source. Source Filename is of the string type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source File Count This MIM parameter contains the number of files that were available to this instance for collection at startup. The value is static throughout the execution of the workflow, even if more files arrive during the execution. The new files will not be collected until the next execution. Source File Count is of the long type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Host This MIM parameter contains the IP address or hostname of the switch. Source Host is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Username This MIM parameter contains the login name. Source Username is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Pathname This MIM parameter contains the value of the directory where the control files will be read. Source Pathname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Storage Status Byte This MIM parameter contains the value of the last byte in the TTSCOF re- cord. Storage Status Byte is of the int type and is de fi ned as a header MIM context type. Accesses The agent itself does not access any MIM resources.",
