    "text": "The ECS Statistics event is triggered when the ECS_Maintenance system task is executed, see Error Correction System for further information about this system task. Filtering In the Event Setup tab, the values for all the event fields are set by default to All in the Match Value(s) column, which will generate event notifications every time the ECS_Maintenance system task is executed. Double-click on the field to open the Match Values dialog where you can click on the Add button to add which values you want to filter on. If there are specific values available, these will appear in a drop-down list. Alternatively, you can enter a hard coded string or a regular expression. The following fields are available for filtering of ECS Statistics events in the Event Setup tab: ECS Statistics event specific fields errorCodeCountNewUDRs - This field enables you create a regular expression based filter for UDRs in state New in order to only generate notifications for UDRs passing the filter. This may be useful for specifying that notifications should only be generated for certain error codes and/or when a certain amount of UDRs have be registered, for example. Specifying error codes errorCodeCountReprocessedUDRs - This field enables you create a regular expression based filter for UDRs in state Reprocessed in order to only generate notifications for UDRs passing the filter. This may be useful for specifying that notifications should only be generated for certain error codes and/or when a certain amount of UDRs have be registered, for example. Fields inherited from the Base event The following fields are inherited from the Base event, and can also be used for filtering, described in more detail in Base Event : category - If you have configured any Event Categories, you can select to only generate notifications for ECS Statistics events with the selected categories. See Event Category for further information about Event Categories. contents - The contents field contains a hard coded string with event specific information. If you want to use this field for filtering you can enter a part of the contents as a hard coded string. However, for ECS Statistics events, everything in the content is available for filtering by using the other event fields, i e eventName, errorCodeCountForNewUDRs, etc. eventName - This field can be used to specify which event types you want to generate notifications for. This may be useful if the selected event type is a parent to other event types. However, since the ECS Statistics event is not a parent to any other event, this field will typically not be used for this event. origin - If you only want to generate notifications for events that are issued from certain Execution Contexts, you can specify the IP addresses of these Execution Contexts in this field. receiveTimeStamp - This field contains the date and time for when the event was inserted into the Platform database. If you want to use timeStamp for filtering, it may be a good idea to enter a regular expression, for example, \"2012-06.*\" for catching all ECS Statistics events from 1st of June, 2012, to 30th of June, 2012. severity - With this field you can determine to only generate notifications for events with a certain severity; Information, Warning, Error or Disaster. However, since ECS Statistics events only have severity Information, this field may not be very useful for filtering. timeStamp This field contains the date and time for when the Execution Context generated the event. If you want to use timeStamp for filtering, it may be a good idea to enter a regular expression, for example, \"2012-06-15 09:.*\" for catching all ECS Statistics events from 9:00 to 9:59 on the 15th of June, 2012. Note! The values of these fields may also be included in the notifications according to your configurations in the Notifier Setup tab.",
