    "text": "The transaction behavior for the Python collection agent is presented here. For more information about general transaction behavior please refer to the section Transactions in Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that changes the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Command Description Begin Batch Emitted when the beginBatch function is called. End Batch Emitted when the endBatch function is called. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents and based on them, generates a state change of the data currently processed. Command Description Command Description Cancel Batch If a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent calls the cancelBatch function block. However, if you have not added the cancelBatch function block to the Python collection agent configuration, and the Cancel Batch command is called by another agent in the workflow, an exception is thrown informing you that the agent does not implement cancelBatch . See Function Blocks for Agents in Batch Workflows . Note! If the Cancel Batch behavior defined on workflow level is configured to abort the workflow, the agent will never receive the last Cancel Batch message. Hint End Batch If a Hint End Batch message is received, the collector may split the batch at an appropriate point. After a batch split, the collector emits an End Batch message, followed by a Begin Batch message (provided that there is more data to be processed). However, if you have not added the endBatchHinted function block to the Python collection agent configuration, and the Hint End Batch command is called by another agent in the workflow, an exception is thrown informing you that the agent does not implement endBatchHinted .
