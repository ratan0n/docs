    "text": "This section includes information about the Batch workflow's Aggregation agent's transaction behavior. The Real-Time Aggregation agent does not have transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Workflow Monitor . Emits The agent emits commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Command Description Cancel Batch The agent itself does not emit Cancel Batch messages. However, if the code contains a call to the method cancelBatch this causes the agent to emit a Cancel Batch. Hint End Batch If the code contains a call to the method hintEndBatch , this causes the agent to emit a Hint End Batch. Retrieves The agent retrieves commands from other agents and, based on those commands, changes the state change of the file currently processed. Command Description Command Description Begin Batch When a Begin Batch message is received, the agent calls the beginBatch function block, if present in the code. End Batch When an End Batch message is received, the agent calls the endBatch function blocks, if present in the code. Prior to End Batch, possible timeouts are called. Thus, when a time limit is reached, the timeout function block will not be called until the next End Batch arrives. If the workflow is in the middle of a data batch or is not currently receiving any data at all, this could potentially be some time after the configured timeout. Cancel Batch When a Cancel Batch message is received, the agent calls the cancelBatch function block, if present in the code.",
