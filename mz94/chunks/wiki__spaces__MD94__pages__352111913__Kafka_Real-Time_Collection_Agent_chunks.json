Starting and stopping workflows will automatically rebalance which partitions the workflows collect from, see Automatic Scale Out and Rebalancing . Workflow Example A simple workflow with a Kafka real-time collection agent can look like this: Open Workflow with Kafka real-time collection agent This workflow example has been created as follows: Workflow Design Create the workflow with the following agents: Agent Configuration Kafka Collects messages from Kafka. Analysis Receives KafkaRecord UDRs and creates output UDRs based on the contents of the input UDR. The offset is used to create a unique id. Encoder Encodes the data to the format the files will be forwarded in. Disk Creates files with the defined format and stores them in the stated directory. Kafka Collector Configure the Kafka real-time collector agent to minimize potential data loss by setting Offset management to At Least Once . Open Kafka Collection Agent. Analysis Agent Configure the Analysis agent to create an output UDR and then map the content of the Kafka message. A unique id is created by using the offset from the input UDR. consume { Default.UFL_test.test_TI myUDR = udrCreate(Default.UFL_test.test_TI); myUDR.offSet = (string)input.offset; myUDR.value = baToStr(input.value); udrRoute(myUDR); }",
