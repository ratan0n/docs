    "text": "This section describes an example based on two workflow configurations that include Diameter agents and profiles. The configurations perform the following tasks: The Diameter client workflow creates a request based on input from a TCP/IP agent and routes it to the Diameter server workflow. The Diameter server workflow creates an answer to the received request and routes it back to the Diameter client workflow. The Diameter client workflow forwards the response to the TCP/IP agent. Follow these steps to run the example: Open the System Importer and select diameter_example.zip . Import all configurations. Add dia1 and dia2 to /etc/hosts . Example - /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.0.1 dia1,dia2 Start the imported workflows. Connect to the TCP/IP agent in the client workflow via netcat (or nc). Enter a string and an integer, separated by a comma. Example - Input to client workflow $netcat localhost 3210 user,10 If the workflows successfully process the input, 1 (one) will be sent to the terminal.",
