    "text": "After Couchbase has been installed, you can create Couchbase profiles to automatically generate buckets in the Couchbase cluster. In the Couchbase Web Console, you can also add more nodes to your cluster if you need to extend the database. Note! Created or updated Couchbase profiles that are used for PCC do not become effective until you restart the ECs. Couchbase Profiles A Couchbase profile is used to read and write bucket data in a Couchbase database. This profile can be accessed by workflows using Aggregation, Distributed Storage or PCC. As a client to Couchbase, the profile operates in synchronous mode. When sending a request to Couchbase, the profile expects a server response, indicating success or failure, before proceeding to send the next one in queue. To create a new Couchbase profile , click on the New Configuration button in the upper left part of the Desktop window, and then select Couchbase Profile from the menu. To open an existing Couchbase profile , double-click on the configuration in the Configuration Navigator , or right-click on the configuration, and then select Open Configuration(s)... . In a Couchbase profile , there are three tabs: Connectivity , Management , and Advanced. Note! To control Couchbase client management timeout as described in https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/2.7/client-settings.html check Couchbase Profile . For information about how to add a server to the Couchbase Cluster, see the official Couchbase documentation: https://docs.couchbase.com/home/index.html",
