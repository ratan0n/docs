    "text": "The Categorized Grouping agent is a processing agent designed to divide incoming data into categories. Each category can contain data from one or more files. When a category closing condition is met, the data collected in a category can be grouped with an external script and the result will be emitted into the workflow. Categorizing Incoming data is divided into categories by the agent. All data assigned the same categoryId will be accumulated in one category. It is performed according to conditions set in APL in the analysis agent, usually preceding the Categorized Grouping agent. Grouping The incoming data accumulated in a category can be grouped into one or several files. Each categorized set of data sent to the agent will have an associated filename, set either by default or in the APL configuration. If no filename is configured in the preceding APL agent a DEFAULT_FILENAME will be automatically set by the agent for each category. The default file will always be situated in the top directory of its category. Closing Conditions A category will be closed as soon as one of the configured closing conditions is met. There are four different closing conditions available to configure in the agent. It is also possible to use APL to add a closing condition. To close a category from APL, it is enough that one UDR sets the closing condition to true . When a closing condition for a category is met, an external script is executed generating a file containing all the data of one category. If the Grouping feature is not enabled, the filename associated with incoming data is ignored and only one file is created for each category. The resulting file is emitted upon a closing condition. This is useful when splitting is desired and grouping is not needed. The external script will not be used. Categorized Grouping Related UDR Types The UDR types created by default in the Categorized Grouping agent can be viewed in the UDR Internal Format Browser in the CatGroup folder. To open the browser open an APL Editor, in the editing area right-click and select UDR Assistance... ; the browser opens.",
