    "text": "Conditional Trace is a trouble-shooting function that allows you to trace data in real-time workflows. Conditional Trace templates, defining what you want to trace, are created in the Legacy Desktop, and these templates can then be used in the regular Desktop. The Conditional Trace templates can be configured to match certain workflows, certain UDR types and fields, as well as using matches for specific parameters, using either specific values or regular expressions. Conditional Trace makes it possible to download and examine selected records from running workflows, making it a very powerful tool for troubleshooting in production environments. For more information on this, see Conditional Trace (CT) . You can also refer to the Conditional Trace User's Guide for a detailed walkthrough.",
