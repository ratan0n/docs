Subfolders in this context are visual representations of areas that you have partitioned to keep your configurations. They are meant to make your configuration browser look neat and tidy. They do not represent actual subfolders. You can enable subfolders to allow you to sort your configurations within your folders, making it easier to maintain larger implementations. To enable subfolders, you must set the property mz.subfolder.enabled to true in the platform.conf file . See Platform Properties for more information on how to set the property. To create subfolders, you must use the valid separators in the folder name when creating a new folder, like the folder names sftp_coll and cipher_sftp_coll shown on the image above. When subfolders are created, configurations are sorted into subfolders determined by the separator used in the folder name. The only valid separators in a folder name are \"_\" or \"-\". If any other character is used as a separator the folder will not appear with subfolders.
