Ensure that the install.type value is set to ec only when upgrading the Execution Container. These properties should be configured according to the platform container setup. For more information, refer to Execution Container Properties . Upgrading the Execution Container To upgrade the Execution Container: Go to the Release Content Directory created during the extraction of the delivered *.tgz file in the Upgrade Preparation step. Execute the upgrade command. Monitor the upgrade progress. Rollback in case of failure. If the upgrade is aborted and a rollback is necessary, use the backups created during the Backup and Upgrade Preparations Steps for EC Containers when Upgrading from 8.3 . Delete the contents in $MZ_HOME and copy the backup mzhome back to the $MZ_HOME. Kill all processes and restart EC/ECSAs. Execution Container Post-Upgrade Steps The ECSA from MZ 8.3 will be automatically converted to ECs while retaining the previous pico name. These ECs will have the same properties as the MZ8.3 ECSAs. Workflows assigned to these ECs will remain Stand Alone - hence behave the same as they did in ECSAs. Restart ECs (in that container) by running the following command: mzsh system start -l Note! Each EC/ECSA will be generated as an EC group, using the same pico name as the EC group name and including the corresponding EC within the group.",
