    "text": "When importing configurations from MediationZone 8.x to 9.x, there is a possibility that there will be agents that are invalid due to changes in the code or agents that are no longer supported on version 9.x. During import of these configurations, these invalid agents will cause the system import to fail, which will result in the workflow containing said agents to not be imported into MediationZone 9.x. To allow you to import the configuration without fail, there will now be a black box to replace any invalid or unsupported agents. The workflow itself will still be imported but it will be invalid and it will be up to you to replace the invalid agents with a new agent of your choosing. The following scenarios will see the agents be replaced as a Black Box agent: An agent that was previously supported in version 8.x but is now deprecated in version 9.x. An agent that is licensed for use in version 8.x but is not included in the license for version 9.x. Custom Developed DTK agents in version 8.x that are not ported. Note! The Black Box agent is meant as a last resort measure when importing configurations from version 8.1 that are not supported, it is highly advisable that you ensure that your MediationZone 9.x installation can support the configuration that you plan to import. Warning! All saved configuration in the agent to be replaced by a Black Box agent will not be retained after importing it into MediationZone 9.x. When importing a workflow that has any agent that will be replaced, you will see the following messages in the import log for the System Importer. The log will display the name of the agent that will be replaced with the Black Box agent. Open System Importer - Import Log Replacing a Black Box Agent To replace a Black Box agent with a suitable replacement agent, you will have to open the workflow that contains the Black Box agent. By selecting the Black Box agent, you will be presented with a menu with options to select from a list of possible replacement agents. Open Example Workflow with APN_2 agent selected Select the replacement agent and click on Yes to confirm the selection. The Black Box agent will then be replaced with your chosen agent. You will be required to configure the agent as if it was a new agent. Open Example Workflow - agent replacement confirmation pop up",
