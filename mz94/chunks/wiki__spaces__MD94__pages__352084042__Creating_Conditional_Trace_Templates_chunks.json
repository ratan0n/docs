    "text": "In the Conditional Trace templates you can either just make generic settings for which workflow(s) to trace on, and trace everything, or you can state which UDR types and fields within the stated workflow(s) you want to trace on, as well as create parameters that you can use for configuring matches that use these parameters to define more specific regular expressions. To create a Conditional Trace template: Click the Build  New Configuration in the upper part of the Desktop window, and then select Conditional Trace Template from the screen. Open Conditional Trace template with specific workflow stated and matchers configured Enter the following general settings: Setting Description Setting Description Workflow State the workflow(s) for which you want to apply a trace in this field. You can either state a specific workflow, or use a regular expression to match several workflows. Max Traces Per EC Enter the maximum number of traces to be performed per EC in this field. Sampling Factor If you have a high throughput and do not want view the hits for every match, you can use this setting to only view every second, or third, or fourth hit, etc. Sampling Factor 2 means only every second hit will be displayed, and Sampling Factor 5 means only every fifth hit will be displayed. Lifetime (s) Enter the automatic timeout of the trace in seconds With these settings you can use the template for tracing all UDRs through all routes and agents in the stated workflow(s). Traced Fields In the tab Traced Fields you can enter regular expressions to specify specific UDRs and UDR fields you want to trace on. Open To add a traced field entry: In the Traced Fields tab, click on the Add button to open the Add Traced Fields dialog. Enter a regular expression for the UDR type in the Typename field. Click on the Add... button and a field is added in the Traced Fields section. Click on the new field and enter a regular expression for the field. Click on the Add button to add a new line in the Traced Fields tab. Repeat the previous 4 steps for all the UDRs and fields you want to add expressions for and then click Close to close the dialog and return to the Traced Fields tab. Matchers and Parameters In the tab Matchers you can state certain UDR types and fields for which you want to do traces. You can also combine this with the parameters configured in the Parameters tab. Open Adding Matchers To add a new matcher without parameters: In the Matchers tab, click on the Add button to open the Add UDR Field Matchers dialog. Open Click on the Browse button next to the UDR Type setting, select which UDR type you want to trace on in the UDR Internal Format Browser and click OK . Click on the Add button to open the Add Field Regexp dialog. Open In this dialog, either the Field or Sub Field must be specified, or both. These fields will be combined into one. To select Field , click on the Browse button next to the Field setting and select which field in the selected UDR type you want to trace on in the UDR Internal Format Browser , and if want to state a Sub Field you can enter it as a qualified name in the Sub Field field before clicking OK . Either enter a regexp, or a specific value matching the field type, you want to trace on in the Value field. Click on the Add button. Repeat the previous 3 steps for all fields you want to add for the selected UDR type and then click Close . Click Add , to add the new UDR type with its stated fields in the Matchers tab. Repeat the previous 7 steps for all UDR types you want to add fields for and then click Close . Using Parameters In the Parameters tab you can configure parameters that can be used when configuring matchers, for example if you want to trace on UDRs that has a certain field added at the end. Open To add a new matcher with parameters: Open In the Parameters tab click on the Add button to open the Add Parameters dialog. Enter a name for the parameter in the Name field, optional validation in the Validation field, and a description in the Description field. Validation is done by using a regular expression. For example \"[0-9]+\" will only allow numbers to be entered. Click on the Add button to add the parameter to the Parameters tab. Repeat the previous two steps for all parameters you want to add. When all parameters have been added, you can proceed with creating matchers according to the description above where you can then use your parameters when creating the regular expressions for the matchers like in the example below. Open Saving the Conditional Trace Template When you are finished with your Conditional Trace Template, click on the Save As button to open the Save As dialog. Select which folder you want to store the configuration in, or create a new one. Enter a name for your Conditional Trace Template in the Name field and click OK . Note! It is recommended that you test the Conditional Trace template in a test environment first so that you can assess the performance impact that your trace filter(s) may have on your production setup.",
