    "text": "The mzsh can be used both as a system administration tool and as a system client tool. When using mzsh without running the platform, mzsh enables you to startup or shut down the system and perform other tasks that are not dependent on having a Platform running. The Platform server process is started by entering the following in the shell: mzsh <username>/<password> startup platform The following text will appear: Starting platform...done. If mzsh is entered while the platform is running, mzsh will become a pico instance, with the ability to manage the system processes. For further information about Pico Clients, see the Desktop User's Guide . Using commands downloaded from Platform requires that the user is logged in. For further information about the Platform, see the System Administrator's Guide . $ mzsh mzadmin/<password> startup platform For example, if the platform has already been started, the following command: $ mzsh startup platform This will generate the following message: Platform is already running. You can only use mzsh in non-interactive mode. Note! Some commands are only available when the Platform is running. This section includes the following subsections: Always Available Available When the Platform Is Running",
