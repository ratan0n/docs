    "text": "You open the Radius Client agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration. To open the Radius Client agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration. Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select a workflow type , select Realtime. Click Add agent and select Radius Client from the Processing tab in the Agent Selection dialog. Radius Servers Tab Open The Radius Servers tab enables you to configure an IP address and a secret key for every RADIUS server that the agent communicates with. Setting Description Setting Description Host Address The IP address or hostname of the RADIUS server. Secret Key The shared secret key is used to sign RADIUS transactions between the server and its client, as well as to encrypt user-password attributes. Throughput Threshold If throttling has been enabled for the host, this field will show the configured threshold for when requests (UDRs) should be throttled. Throttled UDRs will be routed back into the workflow. For example: 1.000 (which means a maximum of 1.000 requests/second will be forwarded). To Add a Server In the configuration for the Radius Client agent, click on the Add button. Open Enter the IP address or hostname and secret key for the server in the Host Address and Secret Key fields. If you want to enable throttling for the host, select the Enable Throttling check box, and then enter the maximum number of UDRs (requests) per second you want the agent to forward in the Throughput Threshold (UDR/s) field. Click on the Add button and the server will be added in the table containing Radius Servers, and then click on the Close button to close the dialog when you are finished adding hosts. Note! Ensure that you handle the throttled UDRs in your APL code in the workflow in order to not loose any UDRs Adding a server from the Workflow Instance view You can define Radius Servers per workflow by setting the property Additional Servers to Default or Per Wrokflow in the Workflow Table tab in Workflow Properties . When defining the servers, you need to follow this json format: [{\"host\":\"<host>\", \"secret\":\"<encrypted password>\", \"maxTps\":\"<value>\"}] This format also applies when using External References . Open Miscellaneous Tab Open Setting Description Setting Description Host Enter the IP address or the hostname via which the agent should bind with the Radius servers. Note! Since the Radius servers are configured to communicate with a specific host on this port, the workflow that includes the Radius agent must be configured to execute on the EC associated with that specific host. Two Radius agents cannot be configured to listen through the same port, on the same host. Source Port The local port via which the agent will bind with the Radius servers. Additional Ports If you want to use a range of ports, enter the number of consecutive ports in this field. For example, if you enter 2000 in the Source Port field and 10 in the Additional Ports field, the ports 2000-2010 will be used. Retry Count This setting defines the maximum number of attempts to send. An attempt to send occurs if a response is not received within the Retry Interval time. If you set this to 0, no retries will be made. Retry Interval Enter the time interval between repeated attempts to send. In the Retry Interval Time Unit setting you can decide if you want to configure this interval in seconds or milliseconds. Retry Interval Time Unit Select in which unit you want to configure the Retry Interval ; Seconds or Milliseconds . Seconds is the default setting. Timeout Resolution (ms) The agent checks whether retries are to be sent at regular intervals. Enter the number of milliseconds you want to have between these checks in this field. Skip MD5 Calculation Select this checkbox to exclude the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm. Note! When the Skip MD5 Calculation checkbox is selected, the authenticator field in all the request messages turns to 0 (zero). Identifier Calculation Select this checkbox if you want an identifier to be calculated and appended to the requests automatically. This identifier will be used for correlating requests with answers. Since the maximum number of pending requests to a specific port is 256, the identifier range will be 0-255. Error Handling Select an Error Route to ensure that all rejected packets are routed into the workflow using this route. This is optional.",
