    "text": "Derby is installed in the Platform Container. The setup is managed by MediationZone itself which means no extra preparations are needed once the general preparations are finished according to General Preparations Platform . Once the container is installed, that is, after you have performed the software installation described in Platform Software Installation , the database files belonging to Derby are placed in a directory called mzdb under MZ_HOME. Note! Since the Derby database runs within the same process as the Platform, the Platform requires more memory than when using Oracle.",
