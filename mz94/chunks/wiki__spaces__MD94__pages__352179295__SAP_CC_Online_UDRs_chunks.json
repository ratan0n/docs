    "text": "The SAP CC UDR types are designed to formalize the exchange between workflows and the SAP Convergent Charging Core Server. The SAP CC agents translate the received charging request UDRs into the corresponding SAP Convergent Charging API call, and translate the response into a charging answer UDR to emit a CCCycleUDR which becomes available in the workflow. The UDRs are grouped into two main categories: The Charging Request UDRs. There is one dedicated UDR for each charging API available on SAP Convergent Charging (for example, BlankChargeUDR , and StartSessionUDR ). The Charging Answer UDRs. There is one dedicated UDR for each charging answer returned by SAP Convergent Charging (for example, PurchaseOrderUDR , StartSessionResultUDR , and CCExceptionUDR ). In addition, a container UDR called CCCycleUDR is used to correlate a charging request with the corresponding charging answer received from SAP Convergent Charging. The SAP CC UDR types can be viewed in the UDR Internal Format Browser in the sapcc folder. To open the browser, open an APL Editor, and, in the editing area, righ t-click and select UDR Assistance . The section contains the following subsections: CCCycleUDR Charging Request UDRs Charging Answer UDRs Spending Status UDRs",
