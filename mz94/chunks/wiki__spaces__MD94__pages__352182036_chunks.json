When the Desktop Launcher connects to the Platform, it automatically downloads and installs the various files that are required to run the Desktop. After a system upgrade, the Desktop Launcher updates these files to ensure that the Legacy Desktop is compatible with the connected Platform. If a new version of MediationZone includes an updated version of the Desktop Launcher it will update itself.",
