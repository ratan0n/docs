    "text": "The SFTP forwarding agent forwards files to a remote host using the SFTP protocol over SSH2. Upon activation, the agent establishes an SSH2 connection and an SFTP session towards the remote host. On failure, additional hosts are tried, if configured. To ensure that downstream systems will not use the files until they are closed, they are maintained in a temporary directory on the remote host until the endBatch message is received. This behavior is also used for cancelBatch messages. If a Cancel Batch is received, file creation is canceled. The SFTP forwarding agent supports IPv4 and IPv6 environments.",
