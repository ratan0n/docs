The UI Builder agent receives HTTP requests from client applications and responds with an HTML page that can be built from the Analysis agent. This Agent provisions the creation of customized user interfaces without the HTML code. With the UI Builder agent and UI Builder components, you can create HTML pages to be viewed in a Web browser. To view a page created using UI Builder you must log in with a MediationZone user having write access to the UI Builder. The agent produces the UI Cycle UDR , which contains both request and response fields. The request fields of the UDR include the header, method, body, and client resource URI. After the Analysis agent has processed the request, the UI Builder agent receives the UI Cycle UDR back, which includes the original request as well as the response. Open Workflow containing a UI Builder Agent The Agent uses HTML code with the Bootstrap library to create responsive pages and Font Awesome to easily present icons. The Font Awesome library requires internet access, but if no internet access is available, the Line Awesome library can be used instead. Example - Create an empty page using the UI Builder agent without APL code in the Analysis Agent. Configure the UI Builder agent as shown: Open UI builder configuration Add the following APL code to the Analysis Agent and then draw a route back to the UI Builder Agent: consume { UICycle cycle = (UICycle) input; cycle.response = udrCreate(UIBuilder.Response); udrRoute(cycle); } Start the workflow and navigate to localhost:8089 using a Web browser. You will see the following page: Open localhost:8089 login page Once you log in with a user having access to the agent, you will see the following page: Open Home page localhost:8089 This section contains the following subsections: UI Builder Agent Configuration UI Builder Agent Input/Output Data and MIM UI Builder Agent Events UI Builder UDRs UI Builder Examples",
