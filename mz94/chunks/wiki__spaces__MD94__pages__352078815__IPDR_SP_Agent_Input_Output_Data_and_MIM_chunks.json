    "text": "Input/Output Data The Input/Output data is the type of data an agent expects and delivers. The IPDR SP agent expects and produces IPDR UDRs of type: Data TemplateData SAMIS SAMIS_TYPE_1 SAMIS_TYPE_2 See IPDR SP UDRs for further information. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes IPDR SP agent MIM values are formatted into a map of <IPaddress;port;session, long/string> . As the IPDR SP agent may contain multiple connection details at any time, the MIM values will have each connection mapped into it and each will have their own specific MIM value. An example for an IPDR SP agent with 3 connection details would be: Throughput Per Second: {10.60.10.136;4741;0, 2000, 10.60.10.136;4740;0, 2000, 192.168.56.101;4737;0, 0} MIM Parameter Description Average DATA_ACKNOWLEDGE Response Time This MIM parameter contains information about the average time (in seconds) of the DATA_ACKNOWLEDGE response from the exporter.
