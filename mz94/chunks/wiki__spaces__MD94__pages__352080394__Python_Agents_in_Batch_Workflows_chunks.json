    "text": "This section describes how to configure Python agents in batch workflows. The following general information applies: Threading Model In batch workflows, the workflow logic is adapted to data execution, in sequential and single-threaded mode. The collection agent controls the main execution thread, and when the thread returns from the collection agent, the workflow will stop. Garbage Collection A UDR that is routed to a Python agent is kept in both the Python and Java heaps as long as it is referenced. When the UDR is no longer referenced in Python, an automatic message is sent to Java saying that it may be released from the Java heap. If you need to route many large UDRs to Python and keep them alive for a longer period of time, a good solution could be to copy the relevant information into a suitable Python structure in order to allow the UDR to be released. If this is not the case, you should not have to take any specific measures in order for garbage collection to work as it should.
