    "text": "This section contains information about how to download and run an example workflow configuration (real-time) with a Disk_Deprecated forwarding agent. In this workflow, a Pulse agent routes PulseUDR types to an Analysis agent. The latter extracts the bytearray payload from the UDRs and routes it to a Disk_Deprecated forwarding agent. The Disk_Deprecated forwarding agent is configured to close batches after every 30 UDRs, however, this condition will not be meet since the preceding Analysis agent will close the batch for every 10 UDRs. To do this, it uses the cyclic sequence number in the PulseUDR , which has a range between 1 and 10. The preceding Analysis agent also publishes a MIM parameter that is used to generate a unique filename for each batch. The example includes the following: Example configuration ( disk_forwarding_real_time.zip ): Follow these steps to install and run the example: Copy the downloaded files to /opt/disk_forw_rt_example on an EC host. Open the System Importer and select in /opt/disk_forw_rt_example/disk_forwarding_real_time.zip . Import all configurations. Start the workflow.",
