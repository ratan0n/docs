    "text": "The UDRs in the PCF.SMPolicy data model store information about different rules regarding the session management in 5G networks. The main objects of PCF.SMPolicy are: Object Description Object Description RulesMapping A flexible mapping table used to map from an external representation to a list of rules. The mapping should not include any information related to a specific subscriber. Target The different rules used by the mapping object, see the sections PCCRule UDR and SessionRule UDR below. PCCRule Rules contains the rule settings regarding session management that should be applied for the subscribers. SessionRule A session rule consists of policy information elements associated with PDU session. A session rule is dynamically provisioned by the PCF to the SMF (i.e., there are only dynamic session rules). This page contains the following sections: 1 Overview of the SMPolicy Data Model 2 RulesMapping UDR 3 Target UDR 4 SessionRule UDR 4.1 Ambr UDR 4.2 AuthorizedDefaultQos UDR 4.2.1 Arp UDR 5 PCCRule UDR 5.1 FlowInformation UDR 5.1.1 EthFlowDescription UDR 5.2 TscaiInputContainer UDR 5.3 DownlinkDataNotificationControl UDR 6 QosData UDR 7 ChargingData UDR 8 TrafficControlData UDR 8.1 RedirectInformation UDR 8.2 UpPathChgEvent UDR 8.3 SteeringMode UDR 9 UsageMonitoringData UDR 10 QosCharacteristics UDR 11 QosMonitoringData UDR 12 ConditionData UDR Overview of the SMPolicy Data Model The different UDRs within the SMPolicy data model are connected as follows: Open Overview of the PCF Rules Data Model RulesMapping UDR In the RulesMapping UDR you set up the priority for the rules mapping, the PCF rules to be applied, products to connect to, etc that the RulesMapping should use. Field Description Field Description ID (int) The unique ID of the RulesMapping UDR. Priority (int) The priority of the mapping item. A low value indicates a high priority. The priority determines the order in which the matched mapping objects are returned. Arguments (list<string>) The arguments of a mapping object, for example the product. The arguments are stated with regular expressions, which means that entering \"Products [2-5]\" will match Products 2, 3, 4, or 5. Targets (list<Target>) A list of Target UDR(s) which represent different SMPolicyDecisions used by the mapping object. The Target UDRs reference the different rules that should be applied. A rule is a set of policy information elements associated with a PDU session, or with service data flows (i.e., with a PCC rule). Two types of rules are defined: Session rule PCC rule Both Session rules and PCC rules are composed of embedded information elements as well as information elements that are part of the referenced objects, for example condition data, or usage monitoring policy data. StopFallthrough (boolean) Used in the rules selection process. If several rules apply, but the one with highest priority has been configured with StopFallthrough set to Yes , only this rule will be returned if it is active. If it is not active, all other active rules that apply will be returned.
