Configure separate Load IDs for each workflow and save. In the forwarding workflow, you can then use these load IDs in the APL for directing certain UDRs to certain workflows. Defining Collector Host If you want to specify which host the forwarding agents are to connect to, you can set the property wfb.host as an execution property in the STR and enter the host that you want the agent to connect to as the value. Example - Setting the collector host $ mzsh topo set topo://container:container1/pico:ec1/val:config.properties.wfb.host <host>",
