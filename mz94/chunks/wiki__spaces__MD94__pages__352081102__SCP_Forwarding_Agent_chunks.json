    "text": "The SCP forwarding agent forwards files to a remote host using the SCP protocol over SSH2. Upon activation, the agent establishes an SSH2 connection and an SCP session towards the remote host. On failure, additional hosts are tried, if configured. To ensure that downstream systems will not use the files until they are closed, they are maintained in a temporary directory on the remote host until the endBatch message is received. This behavior is also used for cancelBatch messages. If a Cancel Batch is received, file creation is canceled. The section contains the following sub-sections: SCP Forwarding Agent Configuration SCP Forwarding Agent Events SCP Forwarding Agent Input/Output Data and MIM SCP Forwarding Agent Memory Management SCP Forwarding Agent MultiForwardingUDR Input SCP Forwarding Agent Transaction Behavior",
