    "text": "The dimension objects in a service model are instantiated during processing. The so called \"instance objects\" are created dynamically, based on the fields in the input data and the service model, and referenced in KPIOutput UDRs. Example - Relation between input data, service model and KPI output Open Example Input, Service Model, and output (incomplete model) Analysis of the example : The figure above has two kpi objects, Region.KPI_01 and Site .KPI_02 . Each node property in the kpi objects describes a path into a tree object, i e tree1/Region/Site and tree1/Region . In this example, there is only one tree with a root node ( tree1 ). The difference between the two kpi objects is that the former refers to the final level in the tree (Site) while the latter only refers to the first level under the root node ( Region ). Both kpi objects refer to the same metric, ExampleMetric , which must also be defined in the service model. Example - Metric The metric in the example above can be derived by applying the function sum on the Value field in input data. \"metric\": { \"ExampleMetric\": { \"fun\": \"sum\", \"expr\": { \"testtype\": \"Value\" } } } The input data contains only one value ( Region_1 ) in the field that identifies region . Two sites ( Site_1 and Site_2 ) are represented in the input data, resulting in separate KPIOutput UDRs for the same kpi object ( Region.KPI_01 ). The value of instancePath is different in the two UDRs: /Region_1/Site_1 /Region_1/Site_2 Note how the value in the field instancePath reflects the path in the service model. A third UDR is created for the kpi object Region.KPI_02 . The node in this object only references Region , which is the same for all the records. The value of instancePath in this UDR is Region_1 .
