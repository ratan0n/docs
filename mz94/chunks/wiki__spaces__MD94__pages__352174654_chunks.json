    "text": "The Data Veracity feature in Data Management allows the user to inspect and maintain Data Veracity records which includes erroneous UDRs and batch files located in Data Veracity. Operators can view and remove Error Codes, Filters, Repair Rules, inspect UDRs as well as Approve or Reject Data Veracity records that have been marked for deletion and edit the content of UDRs. Apart from simply sending a Data Veracity record to Data Veracity, a workflow can be configured to associate user-defined information with the Data Veracity data such as Error Code and MIM information. For cancelled batches, the Error UDR and Cancel Message may contain additional user defined information. Note! Take special precaution when updating the Ultra formats. It is not possible to collect data from Data Veracity if the corresponding UDR has been renamed. If the format definition has changed, you can still collect the data. Changes to the formats are handled as follows: Added or renamed fields will be assigned default values. Removed fields will be ignored. Fields that have changed data types will be assigned default values. Note! Operations that modifies the Data Veracity tables via Data Veracity Data Management will only be allowed by users with appropriate application write access.
