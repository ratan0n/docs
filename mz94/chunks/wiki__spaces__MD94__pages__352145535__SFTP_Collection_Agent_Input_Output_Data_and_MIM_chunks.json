Source Filenames is of the list<any> type and is defined as a header MIM context type. File Retrieval Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the file transfer starts. File Retrieval Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source File Count This MIM parameter contains the number of files that were available for collection at startup in this instance. The value is static throughout the execution of the workflow, even if more files arrive during the execution. The new files will not be collected until the next execution. Source File Count is of the long type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Filename This MIM parameter contains the name of the currently processed file, as defined at the source. Source Filename is of the string type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Files Left This MIM parameter contains the number of source files that are yet to be collected. This is the number that appears in the Execution Manager backlog. Source Files Left is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source File Size This MIM parameter provides the size of the file that is about to be read. The file is located on the server. Source File Size is of the long type and is defined as a header MIM context type. Source Host This MIM parameter contains the name of the host from which files are collected, as defined in the Host field in the Connection tab. Source Host is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Pathname This MIM parameter contains the path from where the currently processed file was collected, as defined in the Directory field in the Source tab. Source Pathname is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Source Username This MIM parameter contains the login username to the host from which the file was collected, as defined in the Username field in the Connection tab. Source Username is of the string type and is defined as a global MIM context type. Accesses The agent does not itself access any MIM resources.",
