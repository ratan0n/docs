    "text": "To open the GTP' LGU Collection agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select workflow type, select Realtime . Click Add Agent and select GTP LGU Collection from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. Source Tab The Source tab includes connection type settings. Open Setting Description Setting Description Port Default value is 3386. Enter the port through which the agent should await incoming data packages. This port must be located on the host where the Execution Context is running. GSN IP Address This is the IP addresses of the GSN nodes that provide the data. Note! If you must specify to which GSN IP address a redirection request is sent by the GTP' server, you can configure this behavior per workflow instance via Workflow Properties on the Workflow Table tab instead of in the GTP' LGU Collection agent configuration dialog. Configuring this behavior via Workflow Properties overwrites the value defined in the agent. Server Port Enter the server port number for each node. The agent detects GGSN source port changes via the Node Alive Request or Echo Request messages. If a change is detected, it is is registered in the System Log. The agent's internal configuration is updated. Response Hosts Enter the IP address(es) used by the network element to send messages to the GTP' server. The GTP' server matches the associated GSN IP address and returns the response. You can configure more than one IP address by separating each host by a semi-colon. Miscellaneous Tab The Miscellaneous tab includes the format and storage settings of the data that is collected by the agent. Open Setting Description Setting Description Format This value must match the Data Record Format in Data Record Packet IE. This is applicable if the Packet Transfer Command is either Send Data Record Packet or Send possibly duplicated Data Record Packet. Perform Format Version Check When this checkbox is selected, the Data Record Format Version in Data Record Packet IE must be identical to the setting in Format Version. Format Version This value should match the Data Record Format version in Data Record Packet IE. This is applicable if the Packet Transfer Command is Send Data Record Packet or Send possibly duplicated Data Record Packet. Directory Enter either the relative pathname to the home directory of the user account, or an absolute pathname of the target directory in the file system on the local host, where the intermediate data for the collection is stored. The intermediate data include: Files that keep track of sequence numbers and restart values. A directory called duplicates, where duplicates are saved. Note! This directory must be attended to manually. Note! When using several Execution Contexts, make sure that the file system that contains the GTP' information is mounted for all Execution Contexts. Acknowledgement from APL Select this checkbox to enable acknowledgement from the APL agent that follows the GTP' LGU Collection agent. This way the GTP' LGU Collection agent will expect a feedback route from the APL module, as well. No GTP' packets will be acknowledged before all the data that is emitted into the workflow is routed back to the collector. Controlling acknowledgement from APL makes sure that complete data is transmitted. Clear the checkbox if you want the agent to acknowledge incoming packets before any data is routed into the workflow. No Private Extension Select this checkbox to remove the private extension from any of the agent's output messages. Use seq num of Cancel/Release req Select this checkbox to change the type of the sequence numbers that are populated in a Data Record Transfer Response to either Release Data Record Packet, or Cancel Data Record Packet, in the Requests Responded field. Otherwise, the agent applies the sequence number of the released, or cancelled, Data Record Packet. Redirection Request Select this checkbox if you want to send Redirection Request messages to all configured GSN nodes when stopping the workflow. The workflow then waits for Redirection Response messages from all the GSN nodes before stopping. However, regardless of this setting, the workflow stops if it exceeds the number of seconds set in the Max Wait for a Response (sec) field, even if it has not received all responses. Advanced Tab Open Setting Description Setting Description Max Wait for a Response (sec) Enter the maximum period while the GTP' LGU Collection agent should expect a Node Alive Response message. If both this value and the Max Number of Request Attempts value are exceeded, a message appears in the System Log. For example: If Max Wait for a Response is set to 20 and Max Number of Request Attempts is set to 5, the warning message is logged after 100 seconds. The value also indicates the maximum period during which the GTP' LGU Collection agent awaits a Redirection Response. This period begins right after the agent releases a Redirection Request to the agents from which it is configured to receive data. Max Number of Request Attempts Enter the maximum number of attempts to perform in order to receive a Node Alive Response and Redirection Response. Max Outstanding Numbers Enter the maximum number of packages that you want kept in memory for sequence number checking. Max Drift Between Two Numbers Enter the maximum numbers that can be skipped between two sequence numbers. Disable Sequence Number Validation Select this checkbox to disable validation of Max Outstanding Numbers and Max Drift Between Two Numbers . Clear Checking Select this checkbox to avoid saving the last sequence number when the workflow is stopped. Clear the checkbox to have the agent save the sequence number of the last collected package when the workflow is stopped. This way, as soon as the workflow is restarted, a package with the subsequent number is expected and the workflow continues processing from the where it stopped. Agent Handles Duplicates Select this radio button to store duplicates in a persistent data directory that you specify on the Miscellaneous tab. The packet remains in the directory until the agent receives a request to release or cancel it. Route Duplicates to Select this radio button to route duplicates to a link that you select from the drop-down list. Alternate Node Enter the IP address of a host that runs an alternate Charging Gateway device as a backup. If you enter an IP address, the GTP' LGU Collection agent includes it in the redirection request that it sends to the GSN. Note! The GTP' LGU Collection agent does not backup any of the data that it manages. Make sure that the GSN node takes care of backup. Decoder Tab Open",
