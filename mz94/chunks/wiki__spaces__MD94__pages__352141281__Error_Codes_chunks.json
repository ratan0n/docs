    "text": "With the Error Codes option, errors can be specified in Data Veracity and associated with erroneous UDRs or batch files. Error Codes can be used when configuring the Data Veracity Collection Agent, serving as an identifier for the workflow to collect specific Data Veracity record UDRs with the corresponding Error Codes. The system includes two predefined error codes, AGGR_UNMATCHED_UDR and DUPLICATE_UDR . The Aggregation and Duplicate UDR Detection agents automatically set these codes when the corresponding error conditions are detected. Users define all other error codes. Note! Error Codes are also used in the Error Correction System (ECS). For more information about ECS and how Error Codes are used in ECS, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/oUL9F . Note! The Sorting by Name column is based on Javas default sorting behavior for Strings(for example, sorting of alphabetical characters in Java is case-sensitive).
