    "text": "The HTTP/2 Client agent allows you to configure an HTTP client in a real-time workflow. The agent sends requests by converting the UDRs to HTTP 2 requests and then receives the responses which are then routed into the workflow. The agent can be used for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. To be able to use the HTTP/2 Client agent, this processing agent must be preceded by an Analysis agent in the workflow that you create. The APL code must include a RequestCycle object as shown in the example APL code below. In the APL code, you must ensure that req.secure is set to true and that req.httpVersion is set to http2 . consume { http.RequestCycle req = udrCreate(http.RequestCycle); req.host = \"myserver\"; req.port = \"8181\"; req.secure = true; req.httpVersion = \"http2\"; req.path = \"/nf-instance\"; req.method = \"GET\"; debug(\"sending request\"+req); udrRoute(req); } Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 (RFC 7540: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540 ) Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 1.1 (RFC 2616: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt ) The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol version 1.3 (RFC 8446: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446 ) mTLS ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.4.2.4 ) This section contains the following subsections: HTTP/2 Client Agent Configuration HTTP/2 Client Agent Input/Output Data and MIM",
