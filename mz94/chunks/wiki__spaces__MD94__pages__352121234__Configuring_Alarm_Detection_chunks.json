    "text": "MediationZone includes the capability to proactively monitor many different parts of the system, and raise stateful alarms if a configured condition is detected. Alarms can be managed within the system, or be sent to any external source such as a network management system using protocols such as SNMP traps, or e-mail. Combinations of multiple alarm conditions can be defined as triggers for an alarm. Open Example of an Alarm Detection configuration with two conditions The Alarm Detection Configuration UI is intended for catching of a small subset of available system events. Available Alarm Conditions: System Event Workflow Alarm Value Workflow Execution Time Workflow Group Execution Time Workflow Throughput MediationZone can integrate with external alarm handling systems using a wide variety of events and metrics. Metrics based events: For alarm conditions that require metrics based data (time series) - for instance infrastructure performance, data processing details, MIMs, etc - Prometheus can be used, as MediationZone has plug-and-play integration. Please refer to section System Insight (SI) . Message based events: Using the Event Notification Manager ( Event Notifications Configuration ), all events in the system can be caught and forwarded to SNMP traps, log files, and databases.",
