All database-related APL functions use a db connection pool, and they pick a connection from the pool for each invocation. Connection properties, such as the transaction state, are handled internally by each function and are never visible in APL. These database functions are currently designed to work with the following database data types; character , string , integer and date data types such as VARCHAR, INTEGER, NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP and BOOLEAN. Other database data types are restricted for APL database functions. The list below contains examples of such types, usually very large data types or custom objects, structures and similar types. Large object data types such as BLOB/CLOB User-defined structures/objects User-defined collections/arrays Spatial/Geometry JSON, XML Note! The BLOB data is parsed and stored as a hex string and CLOB data as a string. To insert BLOB data using APL, you must use string/bytearray. Warning! PostgreSQL does not support BLOB/CLOB. The BLOB equivalent for PostgreSQL will be BYTEA and CLOB equivalent will be TEXT. This section includes the following subsections: Database Table Functions Callable Statements Prepared Statements Database Bulk Functions",
