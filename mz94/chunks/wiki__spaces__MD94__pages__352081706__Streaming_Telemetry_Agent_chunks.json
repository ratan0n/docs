    "text": "This section describes the Streaming Telemetry agent. This is a processing agent for real-time workflow configurations. Streaming telemetry is a push-based mechanism for collecting network performance data, for example from routers, that removes the inefficiencies associated with polling. Streaming Telemetry is used to retrieve router information (OSS data) through streaming. The agent communicates with the routers using the gRPC protocol over HTTP/2. The Streaming Telemetry agent accepts requests without the user or password set since a router may or may not require a username or password. If these fields are not present for JTI, the LoginCheck RPC is not called. This means that the router decides, so if, for example, the user and password are not set and the router requires simple authentication, subsequent subscriptions will fail. For gNMI, the user and password, if present, are inserted in the metadata of the Subscribe RPC. The Streaming Telemetry agent supports gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) and JTI (Juniper Telemetry Interface). The implementations of GNMI and JTI are based on the content of the proto files. The proto files used for the Streaming Telemetry agent can be downloaded by clicking the following links: gnmi.proto gnmi_ext.proto telemetry.proto Prerequisites The reader of this information should be familiar with: protobuf gRPC The section contains the following subsections: Streaming Telemetry Agent Configuration Streaming Telemetry UDR Types Streaming Telemetry Events Streaming Telemetry Input/Output Data and MIM",
