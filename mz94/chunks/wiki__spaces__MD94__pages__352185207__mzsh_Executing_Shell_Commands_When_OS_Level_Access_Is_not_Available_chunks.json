Using the APL https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/TWP9F ScriptExec can address most needs for shell commands that normally would require OS access. The ScriptExec function is executed as a part of the normal workflow execution principles so it can be used by any user who has been granted permissions to design workflow logic and execute workflows. This is done in 3 steps: Create the script that contains the command and its parameters. The script must match any required dependencies in the filesystem. Create a workflow that uses the ScriptExec function to call the script , run it, and capture the execution events. Execute the workflow and analyze the debug output for any errors. When successful, the command is executed in the same way as when a regular shell command is been used. Any errors and information about the execution are shown in the workflow debug events.",
