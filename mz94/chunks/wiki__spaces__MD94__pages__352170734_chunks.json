    "text": "Initially, you must create the UNIX user (preferably mzadmin ) that executes the installation and later on runs pico processes in the Execution Container. This is the user that is referenced throughout this document. During the installation procedure, the default application user , mzadmin , is automatically created. Note that this is not related to the OS user or the DB user. You cannot create or use other application users than this default user until after the installation is complete. Note! The mzadmin user must have read/write permissions for all the directories stated in the Environment Variables. It is not recommended to use root as mzadmin , since this makes troubleshooting difficult. MediationZone should always be administrated by users belonging to the access groups created in MediationZone. See the Desktop documentation for further information on how to create users and access groups. The next step is to install the necessary third-party products, that is, Java. For further information, see System Requirements .
