IPDR SP Agent Open IPDR SP workflow example Example - Analysis agent code in an IPDR SP workflow In this workflow example for the IPDR SP agent the IPDR SP agent sends any of these 4 UDR types: Data, SAMIS, SAMIS_TYPE_1 or SAMIS_TYPE_2 to the Analysis agent, which contains the following code: consume { //Debug the incoming UDR in Workflow Monitor if (instanceOf (input, SAMIS_TYPE_1)) { debug(\"SAMIS_TYPE_1 record DSN=\" + input.SeqNo + \" from \" + input.ConnectionKey); } else if (instanceOf (input, SAMIS_TYPE_2)) { debug(\"SAMIS-TYPE-2 record\"); } else if (instanceOf (input, SAMIS)) { debug(\"SAMIS record DSN=\" + input.SeqNo + \" from \" + input.ConnectionKey); } else if (instanceOf (input, Data)) { debug(\"Data record\"); } //Route the incoming udr to the Encoder udrRoute( input ); } With this code, the Analysis agent will: Check the input from the IPDR SP agent and print the input to the Events panel. Route the input back into the IPDR SP agent. This is done so that the agent is able to generate an ACK to be returned to the exporter. Warning! IPDR Response ACK It is mandatory to configure the Analysis agent to return the input UDR back to the IPDR SP agent. This will notify the IPDR SP agent that the particular IPDR record has been completed successfully by the Analysis agent and enables it to prepare for a data acknowledgement message to be sent back to exporter.",
