    "text": "The configuration dialog consists of the Analysis tab. Analysis Tab The Analysis tab consists of the following settings: Setting Description Setting Description Code Area This is the text area where the APL code, used for UDR processing, is entered. Code can be entered manually or imported. There is also a third possibility, which is to set an import command stated to access the generic code created in the APL Code Editor. Entered code will be color coded depending on the code type, and for input assistance, a pop-up menu is available. See Analysis Agent Syntax Highlighting and Right-click Menu for further information. Below the text area there are line, column and position indicators, for help when locating syntax errors. Compilation Test... Compiles the entered code to evaluate the validity. The status of the compilation is displayed in a dialog. Upon failure, the erroneous line is highlighted and a message, including the line number, is displayed. Outline Use this button to display or hide the APL Code Editor Outline navigation panel. The navigation panel provides a view of all the blocks, variables, and methods in an APL code configuration and makes it possible to easily navigate between different types in the APL code. For further information on the Outline navigation panel, see the section, APL Code Editor Outline in Analysis APL Code Editor . UDR Types Enables selection of UDR Types. One or several UDR Types that the agent expects to receive may be selected. Refer to Analysis Agent Input and Output Types for a detailed description. Set To Input Automatically selects the UDR Type distributed by the previous agent. Restrictions and Differences There are, however, some restrictions and differences to consider when designing a real-time workflow configuration compared with a batch configuration: APL plug-ins with transaction logic are not allowed. The agent will not perform any validation during workflow configuration - the workflow will abort upon activation of illegal code. Note, the user must therefore keep track of what type of plug-ins are invoked. Published MIMs may only be of global type. In order to make functions thread-safe they must be preceded by the synchronized keyword, which will make it possible to alter global variables. It is possible to read global variables from any function block, however, to avoid race conditions with functions updating the global variables, they must only be accessed from within synchronized functions. Synchronized functions cannot utilize the udrRoute command. Function blocks related to batch handling cannot be used. See the APL Reference Guide for further details on the specific commands.",
