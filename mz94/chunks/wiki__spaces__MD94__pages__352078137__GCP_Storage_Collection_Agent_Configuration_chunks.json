    "text": "To open the Database collection agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add Agent and select GCP Storage from the Collection tab of the Agent Selection dialog. The GCP Storage Collector tab contains settings related to the placement and handling of the source files to be collected by the agent. Open Setting Description Setting Description Profile Select the File System profile you want the agent to use, see File System Profile for further information about this profile. File Information Directory The absolute pathname of the source directory on the location stated in the File System profile, where the source files reside. Include Subfolders Select this check box if you have subfolders in the source directory from which you want files to be collected. If you select Enable Sort Order in the Sort Order tab, the sort order selected will also apply to subfolders. Filename Name of the source files in the location stated in the File System profile. Regular expressions according to Java syntax apply. For further information, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html . Example To match all filenames beginning with TTFILE , type: TTFILE.* Compression A compression type of the source file. Determines if the agent will decompress the files before passing them on in the workflow. No Compression - agent does not decompress the files. This is the default setting. Gzip - agent decompresses the files using gzip. Before Collection Move to Temporary Directory If enabled, the source files will be moved to the automatically created subdirectory DR_TMP_DIR in the source directory, prior to collection. This option supports the safe collection of a source file reusing the same name. Append Suffix to Filename Enter the suffix that you want to be added to the file name prior to collecting it. Warning! Before you execute your workflow, make sure that none of the file names in the collection directory includes this suffix. Inactive Source Warning (hours) If the specified value is greater than zero, and if no file has been collected during the specified number of hours, the following message is logged: The source has been idle for more than <n> hours, the last inserted file is <file>. After Collection Move to If enabled, the source files will be moved from the source directory (or from the directory DR_TMP_DIR , if using Move Before Collecting ) to the directory specified in the >Destination field, after the collection. If the Prefix or Suffix fields are set, the file will be renamed as well. Note! It is only possible to move files within the same bucket. Destination The absolute pathname of the directory on the location specified in the referenced File System profile into which the source files will be moved after collection. This field is only enabled if Move to is selected. Rename If enabled, the source files will be renamed after the collection, remaining in the source directory from which they were collected (or moved back from the directory DR_TMP_DIR , if using the Move To Temporary Directory setting). Prefix/Suffix Prefix and/or suffix that will be appended to the beginning respectively the end of the name of the source files, after the collection. These fields are only enabled if Move to or Rename is selected. Note! If Rename is enabled, the source files will be renamed in the current directory (source or DR_TMP_DIR ). Ensure not to assign a prefix or suffix, give files new names, still matching the filename regular expression, or else the files will be collected over and over again. Search and Replace To apply Search and Replace , select either the Move to or Rename setting. Search : Enter the part of the filename that you want to replace. Replace : Enter the replacement text. Search and Replace operate on your entries in a way that is similar to the Unix sed utility. The identified filenames are modified and forwarded to the following agent in the workflow. This functionality enables you to perform advanced filename modifications, as well: Use regular expression in the Search entry to specify the part of the filename that you want to extract. Note! A regular expression that fails to match the original file name will abort the workflow. Enter Replace with characters and meta characters that define the pattern and content of the replacement text. Example - Search and Replace To rename the file file1.new to file1.old , use: Search : .new Replace : .old To rename the file JAN2011_file to file_DONE , use: Search : ([A-Z]*[0-9]*)_([a-z]*) Replace : $2_DONE Note! The search value divides the file name into two parts with brackets. The replacement value applies to the second part with the place holder $2. Keep (days) A number of days to keep source files after the collection. In order to delete the source files, the workflow has to be executed (scheduled or manually) again, after the configured number of days. Note! A date tag is added to the filename, determining when the file may be removed. This field is only enabled if Move to or Rename is selected. Remove If enabled, the source files will be removed from the source directory (or from the directory DR_TMP_DIR , if using the Move To Temporary Directory setting), after the collection. Ignore If enabled, the source files will remain in the source directory after collection. UDR Type Route FileReferenceUDR Select this checkbox to route File Reference UDR instead of raw data.",
