    "text": "Usage usage: wfgroupremovewf <workflow group name> <regexp for workflow name(s)> This command removes one or more workflows from a workflow group. Note! With wfgroupremovewf you cannot remove all the workflows from a group as this will result in an invalid workflow group configuration. In that case, the command aborts and an error message informs you about the abort cause. Since the workflow group should not be emptied, the command enables you to remove all the workflows from the workflow group only if the workflow group also contains a workflow group. This means that after removing all the workflows the parent workflow group is not empty. See the figure below, The wfgroupremovewf Command. Open The wfgroupremovewf command Return Codes Listed below are the different return codes for the wfgroupremovewf command: Code Description Code Description 0 Will be returned if the command was successful. 1 Will be returned if the number of arguments is incorrect. 2 Will be returned if the group is not found. 3 Will be returned if the workflow(s) you want to remove cannot be found. 4 Will be returned if there is no connection to Mgmt_Utils. 5 Will be returned if the group is locked. 6 Will be returned if the updating of group data failed. 7 Will be returned if the configuration lock could not be released. 8 Will be returned if the group is empty (all members have been removed).",
