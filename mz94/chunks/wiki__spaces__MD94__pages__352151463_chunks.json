    "text": "Backup and disaster recovery procedures are recommended tasks to be carried out at a regular basis to avoid performance degradation. Complete system backups to an external disk should be performed at regular time intervals, and preferably at times when the traffic load is low, e.g. at night. The reasonable time interval might be depending on how the system is configured, the amount of traffic, etc, and may vary from installation to installation. General Requirements Regardless of the method chosen for the provisioning of backup and restore operations, there are requirements that must be met: When an instance is restored from a backup image, the database backup must be older than the disk backup. The reason for this is to avoid database references to non-existing data. Temporary files must be excluded from the backups. This is to avoid inconsistent or partial data. Temporary files can be identified by various identifiers that form the file names: Temporary files  Prefixed with \"TEMP.\" DupUDR function temporary files  They are in a separate folder called \"tmp\". InterWorkFlow temporary files  Stored in a separate folder called \"DR_TMP_DIR\". Archiving function files  Stored in a separate folder called \"pending\".
