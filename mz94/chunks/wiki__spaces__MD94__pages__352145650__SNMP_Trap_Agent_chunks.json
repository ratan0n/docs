    "text": "The SNMP Trap agent is used to receive SNMP notifications (traps and informs) and convert them to UDRs. Configuration To open the SNMP Trap agent configuration dialog from a workflow configuration, you can do the following: right-click the agent icon and select Configuration... Double-click the agent icon Open In the agent configuration dialog, select the relevant SNMP Collection profile to use. Resolving Trap OIDs The SNMP Trap agent automatically resolves incoming trap OIDs based on MIB definitions from MIB files, which are loaded into a profile. This is done for both parts of the notification identifier and the list of variable bindings of the trap. Changing the Port 162 Privileges The standard SNMP trap port 162 is not accessible for MediationZone in, for instance, a Linux/Unix environment. Make sure to solve this issue. You can either do: Set up port forwarding from 162 to a port that MediationZone can access using iptables. Change the privileges for port 162, so non-root users can access it. Example - How to set up UDP port forwarding to forward all UDP datagrams from port 162 to port 5678 $ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i enp0s3 -p udp --dport 162 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5678 Replace enp0s3 with the proper network interface name. Use ifconfig to find out the name of your Ethernet interface (usually eth0 ).",
