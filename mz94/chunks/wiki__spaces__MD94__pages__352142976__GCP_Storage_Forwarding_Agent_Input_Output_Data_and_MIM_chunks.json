MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management . Publishes MIM Value Description MIM Value Description MultiForwardingUDR's FNTUDR This MIM parameter is only set when the agent expects input of MultiForwardingUDR type. The MIM value is a string representing the sub path from the output root directory on the target file system. The path is specified by the fntSpecification field of the last received MultiForwardingUDR . For further information about how to use input of MultiForwardingUDR type, see SCP Forwarding Agent MultiForwardingUDR Input . This parameter is of the string type and is defined as a batch MIM context type. File Transfer Timestamp This MIM parameter contains a timestamp, indicating when the target file was created in the temporary directory. File Transfer Timestamp is of the date type and is defined as a trailer MIM context type.
