In order to run KPI Management, you must first provision a service model that includes all the required objects that are listed in the schema below. The following JSON schema describes the data format of a complete service model: JSON schema The aggregated-output object type is optional and contains a boolean value that determines if the KPI output for each dimension will be grouped in the same KPIAggregatedOutput UDR. When the value of this object is set to true , multiple KPIOutput UDRs are grouped by dimension in the same KPIAggregatedOutput UDR. When the value is false (default), each KPI AggregatedOutput will contain one KPIOutput UDR. Example - Aggregated output \"aggregated-output\": true, ... When the value of aggregated-output is true, all kpi objects in the model must have the same window size. Other object types in the JSON schema are described in the following subsections. Note! When a service model contains objects of the same type and with identical names, only one of them will be used. Duplicate object definitions are not detected automatically when you validate the KPI profile. This section has the following subsections: dimension tree metric threshold kpi",
