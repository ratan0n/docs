    "text": "The collecting Inter Workflow agent collects batch files from a storage server. The data that it collects has previously been submitted to the storage server by a forwarding Inter Workflow agent. Note! An Inter Workflow profile cannot be used by more than one Inter Workflow collection agent at a time. A workflow trying to use an already locked profile will abort. Note! In a batch workflow, the collecting Inter Workflow agent will hand over the data, in UDR form, to the next agent in turn, one at a time. In a Realtime workflow, on the other hand, the collecting Inter Workflow agent routes the UDRs into the workflow, one batch at a time. It is possible to restrict memory consumption by setting the property mz.iwf.max_size_block in the <ec>.conf or the platform.conf , on the EC or Platform that runs the Inter Workflow storage. For further information on how to modify properties, see Updating Pico Configurations . If the agent wants to allocate more memory than the given property value during collection, the collection will abort instead of suffering a possible \"out of memory\". The value representation should be in bytes. See the following example: Example - Restricting memory consumption mz.iwf.max_size_block=\"65535\" Note! The minimum value is 32000 bytes, and even if a lower value is configured, 32000 will apply. Every batch file that the agent routes to the workflow is preceded by a special UDR that is called NewFileUDR and contains the n ame of the batch file.
