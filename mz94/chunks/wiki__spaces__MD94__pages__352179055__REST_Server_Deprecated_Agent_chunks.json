    "text": "The REST Server_Deprecated agent allows the receiving of any HTTP requests from client applications and responds with an acknowledgment from the Analysis agent. The agent produces the REST UDR, which contains both request and response fields. The request fields of the UDR include the header, method, body, and client resource URI. After the Analysis agent has processed the request, the REST Server_Deprecated agent routes the REST UDR back, which includes the original request as well as the response from the server that is determined from the APL codes. The REST Server_Deprecated Agent can support the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization with the use of the Authorization Server. The Authorization Server is a service provider in MediationZone that is used to generate OAuth 2.0 access tokens. For further information on how to setup and configure the Authorization Server, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/5uH9F .
