    "text": "This section provides an example of a workflow that sends data from a TCP/IP agent to the LDAP agent in order to request different LDAP operations. The results of the requests are then sent to the Analysis_2 agent, which sends the results via an encoder back to the TCP/IP agent. Open Example of a workflow with the LDAP agent Analysis_1 The TCP/IP agent sends data to Analysis_1 which in turn routes the data in the form of UDRs to the Ldap_1. Open Analysis_1 configuration in the Ldap agent workflow example consume { LdapSearchRequestUDR req = udrCreate (LdapSearchRequestUDR); req.baseDN = \"dc=com\"; req.filter = \"cn=John\"; req.scope = \"subtree_scope\"; udrRoute(req); } LDAP_1 LDAP_1 is configured to send the LDAP operation requests to the LDAP server node. The connection details of the server node are configured in the LDAP agent configuration, in the Connections tab, and the default routing logic is selected, RoundRobin. Open LDAP_1 configuration in the LDAP agent workflow example In this example the default settings are used and no security settings are configured. For details on the different UDRs that can be sent by the LDAP agent to the LDAP server to perform different LDAP operations, see LDAP Agent UDRs . Analysis_2 The corresponding result UDRs are sent by the LDAP agent to Analysis_2, which contain the result information of processing different operations. The possible result UDRs are configured in Analysis_2 as shown in the image below. Open Analysis_2 configuration in the LDAP agent workflow example consume { debug(input); udrRoute(input); } The results of the LDAP requests are then sent back to the TCP/IP agent via an encoder.",
