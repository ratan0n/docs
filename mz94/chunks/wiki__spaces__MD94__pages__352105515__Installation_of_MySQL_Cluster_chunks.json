    "text": "Installing MySQL Cluster involves installation of software on all of the machines that are going to be part of the cluster. The software for the Management Nodes can be installed on the Platform or Execution Container hosts. However, the software for the Data Nodes should be installed on separate machines. For the Platform host, you also need to copy the clusterj-<version>.jar file into the MZ_HOME/3pp directory on the Platform. Installing MySQL Cluster Access to MySQL Cluster from the Execution Zone requires a client library (API) to be installed for the workflow to be able to communicate with the cluster. To make an installation of MySQL Cluster you first have to purchase a copy from Oracle and then follow the official installation instructions provided by Oracle, https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37745_01/html/E38170/ciajejfa.html .
