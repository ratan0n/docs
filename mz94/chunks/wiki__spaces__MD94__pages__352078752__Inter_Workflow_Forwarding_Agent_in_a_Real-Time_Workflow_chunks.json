When prompted to Select workflow type , click Realtime . Click Add agent  Processing tab and select Inter Workflow from the Agent Selection dialog. Double-click the agent icon or right-click the icon and select Edit agent , to display the Agent Con figura tion dialog. Open Setting Description Setting Description Profile The name and most recent version of the profile as defined in the Inter Workflow profile configuration. All workflows in the same workflow configuration can use separate Inter Workflow profiles, if that is preferred. In order to do that, the profile must be set to Default in the Workflow Table tab found in the Workflow Properties dialog. After that each workflow in the table can be appointed different profiles. Named MIM The user defined MIM names according to the definitions in the selected profile. MIM Resource Selected, existing MIM values of the workflow that the Named MIMs are mapped to. This way, MIM values from this workflow are passed on to the collection workflow. Volume (bytes) When the file size has reached the number of bytes entered in this field, the file will be closed as soon as the current bytearray has been included, and stored in the storage directory. This means that the file size may actually be larger than the set value since the system will not cut off any bytearrays. If nothing is entered, this file closing criteria will not be used. Volume (UDRs) When the file contains the number of UDRs entered in this field, the file will be closed and stored in the storage directory. If nothing is entered, this file closing criteria will not be used. Timer (sec) When the file has been open for the number of seconds entered in this field, the file will be closed and stored in the storage directory. If nothing is entered, this file closing criteria will not be used. Enable Worker Thread Select this check box to enable worker thread functionality, allowing you to configure a queue size in order to improve performance and reduce the risk for blocking during heavy I/O. Note! If Enable Worker Thread is deselected and the agent cannot access the storage, the workflow will not abort. This may cause loss of the incoming data. Queue Size Enter the queue size you wish to have for the Worker Thread in this field. Include outstanding Select this checkbox to include outstanding requests in the Queue Size . Use Custom Stream Select this checkbox to enable Stream ID-based connections across multiple workflows using the same profile. When checked, collector and forwarding agents establish connections based on both the profile and a Stream ID, allowing workflows to link dynamically. In cases where a real-time workflow connects to a batch workflow, they scale as a unit, ensuring backend/frontend pairs stay linked via the Stream ID. Note! If this checkbox is cleared, the Inter Workflow profile is fixed at design time and cannot be changed dynamically, preventing chained workflows from scaling. Example - Configuring a Stream ID in Inter Workflow Forwarder and Collection Agents Scenario: You have multiple processing workflows that each need to send data to a specific collection workflow. Instead of creating separate Inter Workflow profiles for each pair, you can configure a stream ID to manage these connections within a single profile. For example, if three processing workflows (A, B, and C) need to send data to three corresponding collection workflows (X, Y, and Z), you can define stream IDs like \"A-X\", \"B-Y\", and \"C-Z\". This ensures each processing workflow sends data to the correct collection workflow while maintaining a simpler, more scalable configuration. Stream ID If you have checked the Use Custom Stream checkbox add a Stream ID. Send response UDR Select to send a UDR with the data and context information as an InterWorkflow.RequestCycleUDR, instead of a bytearray, to the agent. After forwarding, the agent writes the data (or fails to write), and the Inter Workflow forwarding agent responds with confirmation (true or false) of depending on if the write was successful or not. Note! Since there are no natural batch boundaries within a real-time workflow, volume and/or timer criteria must be set to close the file and open a new one. If several criteria for closing the file have been selected, all will apply, using a logical OR. If the workflow is deactivated before any of the file closing criteria has been fulfilled, the UDRs currently stored in memory will be flushed, that is flushed to the current batch without being processed. Hence, the size of the last file cannot be predicted. In case of a crash, the content of the last batch cannot be predicted. The error handling is taken care of by the Inter Workflow collection agent. If the file is corrupt, it will be thrown away and a message is logged in the System Log. The collector will automatically continue with the batch next in order.",
