    "text": "MediationZone is capable of handling various Usage Detail Record (UDR) formats provided that their structure is known. Vendor UDR formats are often complex and hard to work with in agents that will view or manipulate data. Therefore, MediationZone converts the external UDR formats to an internal representation, and vice versa when UDRs are leaving the system, i e decodes and encodes the data. UDR File Editor The UDR File Editor is used to decode batches and view the decoded batch divided into UDR structures without requiring a workflow for processing the data. You can have multiple UDR File Editors opened at the same time, and the UDRs can be opened by double-clicking them and then also edited. If there is an encoder available, it is also possible to encode a new batch. This can be useful in order to test decoder configuration, view key fields of records and generate test data for specific scenarios. The image below shows an MSC binary batch that has been decoded into UDRs and where selected fields configured in a view are presented in individual columns giving an overview of desired fields. Open Example of decoded batch in UDR File Editor The figure below shows the content of one of the selected UDRs. The fields are fully editable and the records can be encoded to generate output files.
