To open the Compressor processing agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to Select workflow type, select Batch . Click Add agent and select Decompressor from the Processing tab of the Agent Selection dialog. Open The Decompressor agent configuration dialog Setting Description Setting Description Compression Select decompression algorithm: No Compression: The agent will not decompress the files. Gzip: The agent will decompress the files by using gzip. LZO: The agent will decompress the files by using LZO. Error Handling Select how you want to handle errors for files that cannot be decompressed: Cancel Batch: The agent will cancel the batch when a file cannot be decompressed (Default). The default setting for Cancel Batch is to abort the workflow immediately, but you can also configure the workflow to abort after a certain number of consecutive Cancel Batches or to never abort the workflow on Cancel Batch. See Workflow Properties for further information about Workflow Properties. Ignore: The agent will ignore an input batch when a file cannot be decompressed, and a log message will be generated in the System Log, see System Log . Note! If you select the Ignore option, data will continue to be sent until an error occurs in a batch, which means that erroneous data might be routed from the Decompressor agent. Transaction Behavior This section includes information about the Decompressor agent's transaction behavior. For information about the general transaction behavior, see Workflow Monitor . The agent emits commands that change the state of the file currently processed. Command Description Cancel Batch Emitted if a file cannot be decompressed. If you have configured the workflow to abort after a certain number of consecutive Cancel Batches, or never to abort on Cancel Batch, in the Workflow Properties, the collection agent will send the file to ECS along with a message describing the error. See Workflow Properties and Error Correction System for further information. The agent does not retrieve anything. Input/Output Data Input/Output data is the type of data that an agent both recognizes and delivers. The Decompressor agent consumes and delivers bytearray types. MIM For information about the MIM and a list of the general MIM parameters, see Administration and Management in Legacy Desktop . Publishes The agent does not publish any MIM resources. Accesses MIM Parameter Description Source Pathname This parameter is read from the workflow's collecting agent, in order to create accurate Agent Message Events. Source Filename This parameter is read from the workflow's collecting agent, in order to create accurate Agent Message Events. Agent Message Events The agent generates event messages according to your configuration in the Event Notification editor. Ignored batch OR Ignored batch. The file <filepath/filename> could not be decompressed. Reported when a batch cannot be decompressed and Error Handling is configured with ignore , see the section above, Configuration.
