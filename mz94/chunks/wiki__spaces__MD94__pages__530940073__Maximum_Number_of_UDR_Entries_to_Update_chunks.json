    "text": "To ensure that the platform, using a standard 256 Mb heap size, does not run out of memory, the maximum number of UDR entries to update or delete is limited to 15,000,000 UDR entries. However, this limit can be increased using the Platform property mz.ecs.max.udr.update in the configuration file for the platform instance. Example - Setting the property mz.ecs.max.udr.update to 25000000 mzsh topo set topo://container:<platform container>/pico:platform/val:config.properties.mz.ecs.max.udr.update 25000000 Note! When increasing the default limit, you may have to increase the Platforms maximum heap size as well. This is done by changing the -Xmx parameter in the configuration file for the Platform instance. As a general rule, the ECS needs another 10 Mb Platform heap space for every additional one million UDRs. After performing the search, the ECS Inspector populates the table with the matching results. Each row in the table represents either a single UDR or a batch. Note! The ECS Inspector caches results when you populate a list (such as Error Codes). This caching helps avoid the unnecessary loading of workflow names, agent names, and error codes, which can be performance-intensive. Click the Refresh button to refresh the search dialog and repopulate the list.",
