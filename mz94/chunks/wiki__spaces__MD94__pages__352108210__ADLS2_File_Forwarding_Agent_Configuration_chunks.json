Advanced Tab Open ADLS2 file forwarding agent configuration dialog - Advanced tab Setting Description Setting Description Block Size (MB) The size of each block to be staged. It determines the number of requests that are required. Note! Entering a large block size will ause the upload to make fewer network calls.

If the size of the data entered is less than or equal to this value, the data will be uploaded in a single batch instead of several batches.
