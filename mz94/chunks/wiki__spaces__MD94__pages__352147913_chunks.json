To tell the difference between the applications and their respective views you can vary the background color of every Desktop. To change the Desktop application background color, set the Desktop property mz.gui.color.space.active . The value can be any color of the following: blue, green, yellow, orange, red, dark blue, dark green, magenta, or dark red. For further information about Desktop properties, see Legacy Desktop Properties . Dynamic Update While a real-time workflow is being executed, you can change the value of the following parameters: The Host and Port parameters of the TCP/IP agent The NAS list of the Radius agent To be able to dynamically update TCP/IP Host and Port parameters, you need to set them to either Default or Per Workflow in the Workflow Properties dialog box. See the figure The Workflow Table Tab in Workflow Table Tab . To update, select Dynamic Update . On the title bar of the monitor dialog box, the text Dynamic Update followed by a number appears. It represents the number of times that you have updated the workflow configuration while running it, that is since the last time you started it. Open Dynamic update Folders Folders enable the user to categorize configurations and simplify their maintenance and operation. Folders can be created based on traffic type, decode for a specific network element, be based on geographic location, etc. There is a system folder named Default . This folder cannot be renamed or removed. Configuration Naming Configuration names within a folder must be unique. Some named items in the environment are used when constructing file names. To avoid potential conflicts in the file systems, MediationZone converts the conflicting characters when constructing file names. The following characters are allowed. Any other character results in a validation error. a-z A-Z 0-9 - (dash) _ (underscore) The system has an internal key for every configuration. This key is used to identify the configuration. Renaming a configuration does not change this key. The key is constructed using the system name and the date when the configuration was created. You can view the generated key by selecting the Show Properties option in the right-click menu in the Configuration Navigator, as well as in the Configuration Browser and Configuration Tracer. Date and Time Format Codes In various places, date formats are entered. The following list shows valid date and time format codes that can be combined with any characters that are not in the ranges of 'a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z'. For instance, characters such as ':', '.', ' ', '#' and '@' will appear in the resulting time even if they are not specified within single quotation marks. The date syntax conforms to the Java class SimpleDateFormat . This section contains a summary only. For a full description see: SimpleDateFormat (Java Platform SE 8 ) .

You can insert fields in the target text field by double-clicking them, or by selecting them followed by Apply . The OK button is not available. MIM Some agents in a workflow need information from the workflow or other agents in order to operate. For instance, an agent that produces a file might need the source file name and the number of processed UDRs to be used in the outgoing file name. In order to satisfy these requirements, MediationZone uses a model called Meta Information Model (MIM) . Agents may use MIM parameters to publish information during run-time that other agents may need to use. The MIM information is used in various parts of the system, for instance, when selecting which MIM resources to use in a file name. MediationZone uses Java Management Extensions (JMX) to monitor MIM tree attributes in running workflows. For more information, refer to Workflow Monitor . Open A MIM tree example MIM resources for each agent have their values assigned at any time, depending on type. As an example, the Disk collection agent publishes the MIM resource Source Filename which is set at Begin Batch. The agent puts the name of the collected file in this resource before it starts collecting the file. There are four types of MIMs in total: MIM Type Description MIM Type Description Batch Batch MIMs are dynamic values, populated during batch processing. An example of such a value is outbound UDRs. Global A global MIM value can be accessed at any time during the execution phase of a workflow. For instance, static values such as Agent Name. Header Header MIM values are populated when a batch is received for processing (an agent emits Begin Batch ). For example, Source Filename (published by the Disk collection agent). Trailer Trailer MIM values are populated after a batch is processed (an agent emits End Batch ). An example of such a value is Target Filename (published by the Disk forwarding agent). By default, all agents may publish the following MIM resources depending on their Input/Output data types. MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Agent Name This MIM parameter contains the name of the agent as defined in the workflow editor. All agents publish this resource. The value is set when the workflow starts executing. Agent Name is defined as a global MIM context type. <route name> UDRs (or Bytes) This MIM parameter contains the number of UDRs (or Bytes) routed on the link by the agent. The value is updated continuously during processing. This MIM is not valid for forwarding agents. <route name> UDRs (or Bytes) is defined as a batch MIM context type. <route name> Queue Size This MIM parameter contains the number of objects that are currently in the route's queue. <route name> Queue Full Count This MIM parameter contains the number of queue state changes. The value is updated each time a route's queue enters \"full\" state. Inbound UDRs (or Bytes) This MIM parameter contains the number of incoming UDRs (or Bytes) since last Begin Batch. The value is updated continuously during batch processing. This MIM is not valid for collection agents. Inbound UDRs (or Bytes) is defined as a batch MIM context type. Outbound UDRs (or Bytes) This MIM parameter contains the number of outgoing UDRs (or Bytes) since last Begin Batch. The value is updated continuously during batch processing. This MIM is not valid for forwarding agents. Outbound UDRs (or Bytes) is defined as a batch MIM context type. Note! Some MIM resources are not available until the agent to which they belong is configured. There are also pico specific MIM resources representing information about the picos' JVMs. These are: MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Available CPUs This MIM parameter states the number of processors that are available for the JVM. Available CPUs is defined as a global MIM context type. System Load Average This MIM parameter states the average system load during the last minute. The system load is the sum of the number of runnable entitites that are queued or running on the available processors, and this value shows the average of this sum for the last minute. This information is useful for indicating the current system load and may be queried frequently. System Load Average is defined as a global MIM context type. Heap Memory Used Percentage This MIM parameter states JVM's heap size, i.e. the amount of memory that is currently used by the JVM, in percent. Heap Memory Bytes Usedn is defined as a global MIM context type. Non Heap Memory Used Percentage This MIM parameter states the amount of memory outside of the heap (non-heap memory) that is currently used by the JVM, in percent. Non Heap Memory Bytes Used is defined as a global MIM context type. There are workflow specific MIM resources representing information of a running workflow. These are: MIM Parameter Description MIM Parameter Description Batch Cancelled This MIM parameter states if the current batch has been cancelled. Batch Cancelled is defined as a header MIM context type. Batch Count This MIM parameter contains a unique sequence number that is associated with each batch processed by the workflow. This value is increased by 1 up to 2 63 and is saved between workflow invocations. Batch Count is defined as a header MIM context type. Batch Duration This MIM parameter contains the time it took to process a batch. This value is updated during processing. Batch Duration is defined as a batch MIM context type. Batch End Time This MIM parameter contains the end time for the processing of a batch. Batch End Time is defined as a trailer MIM context type. Batch Start Time This MIM parameter contains the start time for the processing of a batch. Batch Start Time is defined as a header MIM context type. Execution Context This MIM parameter contains the name of the Execution Context hosting the current workflow. Execution Context is defined as a global MIM context type. Processed UDRs Interval Duration This parameter contains the duration of an interval in minutes for counting the number of processed UDRs in the current real-time workflow. This MIM parameter is only valid for real-time workflows. Processed UDRs Intverval Duration is defined as a global MIM context type. Processed UDRs Per Interval This parameter contains the UDRs processed during the defined interval in the current real-time workflow. This MIM parameter is only valid for real-time workflows. Processed UDRs Per Intverval is defined as a global MIM context type. Start Time This MIM parameter contains the date and time when the workflow was started. The value is set when the workflow is activated. Start Time is defined as a global MIM context type. Threads Configured This parameter contains the number of workflow threads configured in the current real-time workflow. This MIM parameter is only valid for real-time workflows. Threads Configured is defined as a global MIM context type. Threads Idle This parameter contains the number of workflow idle threads in the current real-time workflow. This MIM parameter is only valid for real-time workflows. Threads Idle is defined as a global MIM context type. Throughput By default, Throughput is the volume-per-time processing rate of a particular workflow or agent. Transaction ID Each batch closed by all workflows receives a unique transaction ID. Cancelled batches receive one as well. This MIM parameter contains the unique transaction ID. Transaction ID is defined as a header MIM context type. Workflow ID This MIM parameter contains the unique identification name of every workflow. Workflow Name This MIM parameter contains the name of the current workflow. The value is set when the workflow is activated. Workflow Name is defined as a global MIM context type. MIM Browser In places where access to MIM resources is needed, the MIM Browser is used. You access the MIM Browser from the Analysis or Aggregation agent, by right-clicking in the APL Code area and selecting MIM Assistance... . The browser contains all MIM resources available in the workflow: Open The MIM Browser The available MIM resources are displayed, ordered in a tree structure. Choose the MIM resource by double-clicking the MIM resource, or by selecting it followed by Apply . Cancel dismisses the dialog. You can also search for a specific MIM resource using the filter text box at the top of the MIM Browser . Locks Configurations that you edit are locked so that they cannot be modified by other users. When you open a locked configuration, a message box appears with information about the user that has access and can edit it. To edit a locked, or read-only, configuration you can save a copy of it with a different name. Open A locked configuration Locks are not persistent. If the system is restarted, all locks are forgotten. Encryption A configuration is persisted using XML and therefore more or less available in a readable form to any user. Some configurations may be sensitive and possibly contain descriptions that are proprietary and must be protected. To protect such configurations, it is possible to encrypt configurations using a passphrase. A configuration is thereby only readable if the passphrase is known by the user. If the passphrase is lost, the configuration should be considered lost as well. There are configurations that generate information to the system, for example, the Ultra format that renders UDRs. A user can have access to the UDRs without knowing the passphrase for the configuration source, by setting the user group execute permission. A user can also import a format or analysis package which has execute permission configured. Encrypted configurations retain their encryption and passphrase across export and import. This means that to open a configuration that is imported from another system, you need its passphrase. The Database profile and some of the agents can use passwords from External References. These can be encrypted, either using the default key, or using a crypto service keystore file. See Using Passwords in External References in External Reference Profile for further information.",
