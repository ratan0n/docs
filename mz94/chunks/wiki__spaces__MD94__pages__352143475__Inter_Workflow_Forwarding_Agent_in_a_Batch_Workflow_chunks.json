Open Setting Description Setting Description Profile The name and most recent version of the profile as defined in the Inter Workflow profile configuration. All workflows in the same workflow configuration can use separate Inter Workflow profiles, if that is preferred. In order to do that the profile must be set to Default in the Workflow Table tab found in the Workflow Properties dialog. After that each workflow in the table can be appointed different profiles. Named MIM The user defined MIM names according to the definitions in the selected profile. MIM Resource Selected, existing MIM values of the workflow that the Named MIMs are mapped to. This way, MIM values from this workflow are passed on to the collection workflow. Produce Empty Batches If enabled, empty files will be created even if no UDRs are forwarded from a batch. Use Custom Stream Select this checkbox to enable Stream ID-based connections across multiple workflows using the same profile. When checked, collector and forwarding agents establish connections based on both the profile and a Stream ID, allowing workflows to link dynamically. In cases where a real-time workflow connects to a batch workflow, they scale as a unit, ensuring backend/frontend pairs stay linked via the Stream ID. Note! If this checkbox is cleared, the Inter Workflow profile is fixed at design time and cannot be changed dynamically, preventing chained workflows from scaling. Example - Configuring a Stream ID in Inter Workflow Forwarder and Collection Agents Scenario: You have multiple processing workflows that each need to send data to a specific collection workflow. Instead of creating separate Inter Workflow profiles for each pair, you can configure a stream ID to manage these connections within a single profile. For example, if three processing workflows (A, B, and C) need to send data to three corresponding collection workflows (X, Y, and Z), you can define stream IDs like \"A-X\", \"B-Y\", and \"C-Z\". This ensures each processing workflow sends data to the correct collection workflow while maintaining a simpler, more scalable configuration. Stream ID If you have checked the Use Custom Stream checkbox add a Stream ID.",
