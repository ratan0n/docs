    "text": "When you configure SSL for Kafka, there are a few considerations you need to make for batch workflows. Since the system saves the transactions in Kafka via the two automatically created topics txn_status and wf_txn , a batch workflow will always act as both producer and consumer even if the workflow contains only a collection Kafka agent or only a forwarding Kafka agent. This means that you need to configure SSL for both consumer and producer in the Kafka Profile used for all batch workflows. To set up SSL using Java Keystore: Configure a Security profile with Java Keystore: Open Security profile with Java Keystore configured If you want to have separate Security profiles for the Consumer and Producer, configure a second Security profile in the same way as described in step one, otherwise skip to the next step. Configure the Kafka profile with the relevant Security profile selected for the consumer and producer, and SSL properties configured in both the Advanced | Producer and Advanced | Consumer tabs, even if your workflow only contains a Collection or only a Forwarding Agent. Open Security profile selected for Consumer and Producer Open SSL properties set for Consumer Open SSL properties configured for Producer",
