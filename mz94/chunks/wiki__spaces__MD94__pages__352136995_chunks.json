    "text": "If you are upgrading from MediationZone 9.0. or later, and have workflow packages containing workflows with Web Services, you need to perform some additional steps before and after the upgrade of MediationZone to achieve a successful upgrade. If you do not perform these steps, the workflows using Web Services in workflow packages will abort after the upgrade. To ensure workflow packages containing workflows with Web Services function correctly after the upgrade, follow these steps: Before initiating the upgrade, generate new versions of the workflow packages containing workflows with Web Services. This needs to be done in an environment where MediationZone 9.1 is already installed. Upgrade MediationZone according to the regular instructions Upgrade . Once the upgrade is complete, import the new versions of the workflow packages that you generated in step 1 and switch to the new workflow package version. See Workflow Packages for more information about Workflow Packages. We recommend that you test the steps in a test environment before the production upgrade.",
