    "text": "In this scenario, MediationZone needs to be upgraded. Open Chain of events: One of the MediationZone systems is designated master and is updated with the most recent versions of all the configurations, typically by importing a fresh export made from the production system. The master MediationZone is upgraded by following the upgrade instructions in the Installation Instructions. When the system has been upgraded successfully, the configurations are exported to the local working copy using the vcexport command. The resulting XML files are compared with the ones in the Version Control System. Any changes to the files will be the result of a configuration upgrade or changes triggered by the upgrade. The new exported configurations are checked into the Version Control System. The rest of the MediationZone systems are upgraded. The latest versions of the configurations are checked out from the Version Control System and imported into the MediationZone systems.",
