If an import entry conflicts with an entry that already exists in the current system, the entry will not be imported. An example of such a conflict might be an identical entry name, but a different ID. A workflow group that is scheduled to start while an import activity is happening will not start until the import is complete. [-s|-skipexisting] If you choose to set the skipexisting parameter, the imported data will not overwrite existing configurations that have the same key, name, type, and folder. This means that repeatedly importing a configuration does not overwrite the data. [-pp|-preservepermissions] When user permissions are modified, set the preservepermissions parameter to prevent user permissions in the current system from being updated while importing a configuration. [-nameconflict re | an | sk | ask] This parameter enables you to identify an imported configuration with a name that is identical to the name of a configuration that already exists in your system. Using this parameter requires that you specify what you want to do with the imported configuration: re (REplace): Overwrite the current configuration with the imported one. an (Add New): Add the imported configuration to your system. To resolve the name conflict, the new configuration's name is extended with _1 at the end. sk (SKip): Ignore the conflicting imported configuration. ask : Prompt when a conflict is detected. [-keyconflict re | an | sk | ask] This parameter enables you to identify an imported configuration with a key that is identical to the key of a configuration that already exists in your system. Using this parameter requires that you specify what you want to do with the imported configuration. For information about the keyconflict options, see [-nameconflict re | an | sk | ask]. Example - [-keyconflict re | an | sk | ask] The command mzsh mzadmin/dr systemimport -keyconflict ask import.zip is applied with the ask option and detects a key conflict. ... [Configuration/Event Notification] - Importing Default.extraKey2... Event Notification configuration with the same key but with a different type, folder or name already exist! Existing name is: Default.existingConfiguration Imported name is: Default.importedConfiguration What do you want to do? 1) Replace existing configuration 2) Import as a new configuration 3) Skip > 1 Use this alternative for all configurations of this type? 1) Yes 2) No > 2 [-namekeyconflict rn | rk | an | sk | ask] This parameter enables you to identify an imported configuration with a name as well as a key that is identical to a name and a key of two different configurations that already exist in your system. Using this parameter requires that you specify what you want to do with the imported configuration: rn (Replace Name conflict): Replace the configuration whose name conflicts with the imported configuration. rk (Replace Key conflict): Replace the configuration that key conflicts with the imported configuration. an (Add New): Add the imported configuration to your system. sk (SKip): Ignore the conflicting imported configuration. ask : Prompt a message when a conflict is detected. [ -he|-holdexecution [ r | sr | sir | wr ] ] Example. Using the holdexecution parameter $ systemimport -s -he r export.zip $ systemimport -s -he sr export.zip $ systemimport -s -he sir export.zip $ systemimport -s -he wr export.zip Use the hold execution parameter to prevent scheduled workflow groups from being started while importing configurations. If a workflow or a workflow group does not stop within 5 minutes (300 seconds) when applying systemimport with either one of the following holdexecution parameters: sr , sir , and wr , a timeout will occur. You can change the timeout value by setting the Platform property mz.import.suppress.timeout . When import is complete and a workflow group is still running, systemimport -holdexecution [ r | sr | sir | wr ] awaits the current running workflow member to come to a stop, and then restarts the whole group instead of continuing the execution of the member that follows. If you do not specify any of the r , sr , sir or wr options: A batch workflow or a workflow group will remain suppressed until all the workflows finish executing. Then, the workflow or the members of the workflow group, become idle. A real-time workflow group will return to the running state. systemimport -holdexecution generates events. To retrieve the events data, configure the Event Notification Editor to transfer it according to your preferences. For information about the Suppressed Event event type, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/7zb8F in the Desktop user's guide. holdexecution Parameters Select the action that should resolve held executions: r (restart): When the import activity is done, and a workflow group is partly executed, specifying this option will restart that workflow group. Workflow groups that are fully executed, will not be restarted. A workflow that is started manually, will be restarted if it has been stopped. sr (stop and restart): Stops the workflows or workflow groups that are still running after an import is complete, waits for them to come to a stop or finish processing a batch, and then restarts synchronously all the workflow groups and all the manually started workflows that had not executed completely within the timeout boundaries. sir (stop immediately and restart): Stops the workflows or workflow groups that are still running after an import is complete, even in the middle of processing a batch, and synchronously restarts all the workflow groups and all the manually started workflows that had not executed completely within the timeout boundaries. Note! An Unreachable workflow is restarted once contact with the Execution Context that it runs on, is regained. For further information about the Unreachable state, see https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/Gbb9F in the Desktop User's Guide . wr (wait for completion and restart): After an import is complete, synchronously restarts all the workflow groups and all the manually started workflows that had not executed completely within the timeout boundaries. Note! Any workflow that runs past the timeout limit is restarted as soon as it completes execution. For further information about holding an execution, see the description of the Suppressed workflow group state in the Desktop Users Guide linked above. [-nr|-norollback] When you use systemimport , a file that contains rollback information will be created. This file contains data about configuration changes during the system import and is saved in the directory where you apply the command. You use the rollback file to undo a system import and return to the configuration that you had before the system import. To suppress the creation of the rollback file, provide either a nr or a norollback option. [-no|-newowner] Change ownership of the configuration on import. Must match a user already defined in the https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/rbn8F [-select <xml-selection file> [ -dryrun ] [ -onError < ABORT | ASK | IGNORE >] The -select <xml-selection file> parameter enables you to: Provide systemimport with an XML file that specifies your selection of configurations and workflow tables. Use [ -dryrun ] to test data compatibility before importing Use [ -onError < ABORT | ASK | IGNORE > ] to manage an occurrence of an error XML Selection File The selection information in the XML selection file corresponds to the selection information that you specify on the System Import tool view, in the Desktop user interface. The XML selection file consists of two main tags: <configurations> : contains your configuration import selections <workflows> : contains your workflow tables import selections <configurations> Select configurations from the <Export file|directory> that systemimport imports. Use the resolveDependencies attribute to either include (true), or ignore (false), dependent configurations. See the following example. Example - The resolveDependencies attribute <import> <configurations> <!-- Ignoring dependencies of the Default.x configuration--> <configuration name=\"Default.x\" resolveDependencies=\"false\"/> <!-- Including dependencies of the Default.y configuration--> <configuration name=\"Default.y\" resolveDependencies=\"true\"/> <!-- Ignoring dependencies of the Default.z configuration--> <!-- Note: Equal to selection of Default.x above --> <configuration name=\"Admin.C07E02_DEMO_BWF\"/> <!-- Ignoring dependencies of configurations within the folder --> <configuration foldername=\"systemunits\"/> <!-- Including dependencies of all the configurations in the folder --> <configuration foldername=\"billing\" resolveDependencies=\"true\"/> </configurations> </import> To import all the configurations that are included in a specific folder, include the following text in the XML file: <configuration foldername=\"myFolder\"/> Note! If you specify configuration selections in the XML file that do not exist in the Export file, a warning is generated. <workflows> This XML tag enables you to use systemimport [-select <xml-selection file>] to import both workflow configurations and their CSV file in one action. Use this tag to associate workflow tables with CSV data files. Example. The XML selection tags <import> <configurations> <configuration name=\"Common.DB_PROFILE\"/> <configuration name=\"Common.APL_PROFILE\" resolveDependencies=\"true\"/> <configuration foldername=\"myFolder\"/> </configurations> <workflows > <workflow name=\"Mobile.FTP_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/FTP_workflows.csv\"/> <workflow name=\"Mobile.SFTP2_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/SFTP2_workflows.csv\" resolveDependencies=\"true\"/> <workflow name=\"Mobile.GGSN1_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/GGSN1_workflows.csv\" resolveDependencies=\"true\" onError=\"ask\"/> <workflow name=\"Mobile.GGSN3_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/GGSN3_workflows.csv\" resolveDependencies=\"true\" onError=\"ignore\"/> <workflow name=\"Mobile.GGSN4_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/GGSN4_workflows.csv\" resolveDependencies=\"true\" onError=\"abort\"/> <workflow name=\"Mobile.GGSN5_workflow\" wfTable=\"/home/user1/GGSN5_workflows.csv\" resolveDependencies=\"true\" keepOld=\"false\" encryptPassword=\"password\" onError=\"ask\"/> </workflows> </import> [-dryrun] Prior to importing, use systemimport with the dryrun switch to verify that the CSV data, such as number of columns or names, matches the contents of the workflow table. If a mismatch is detected a report will be generated. [-onError] If the onError attribute is not specified in the XML selection file, the value that you set it to in systemimport, is the value that applies. Otherwise, the attribute value applies. Set [-onError] to any of the following values: ask : to generate an interactive message ignore : to do nothing abort : to abort the command and stop a current configuration import [-m|-message] If you want to add a comment when making a systemimport , the -m or -message option can be used as in the following example: Example - message mzsh <username>/<password> systemimport -m \"My Import\" /home/Directory/<file to import>.zip \"My Import\" will be the comment. The comment will replace the default information saved when making a system import, and will be included in the System Log message that is generated, and visible when selecting to view history in any of the configurations in the imported data. [-u|-upgrade] When exports have been made in a previous version of MediationZone, they may have to be upgraded. In this case, you can use the -u or -upgrade option as in the following example: Example - upgrade $ mzsh <username>/<password> systemimport -u <file to import>.zip The configurations will then be upgraded. [ -eu|-enableusers ] If you want imported users to be active after you run the import, use the -eu or -enableusers option as shown in the following example: Example - enableusers $ mzsh <username>/<password> systemimport -eu <file to import>.zip By default, users are imported as inactive and must be activated manually via the Access Controller. This option is only available when you run an import as a super user. If you use this option as another user, users will be skipped during the import. <export file|directory> Specify the path to the directory or ZIP file that contains the configurations you want to import. [password] To import encrypted configurations, provide a password.
