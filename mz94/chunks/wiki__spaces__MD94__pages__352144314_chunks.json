    "text": "Prometheus UDR You use PrometheusUDR s to create metrics. The PrometheusUDR has to be populated with a value and optional Prometheus labels. You can decide if you want to create a PrometheusUDR per each value, or aggregate them using the Aggregation agent and send a cumulative value after desired conditions are met. Labels should follow the Prometheus recommendation; for details see the official Prometheus documentation, Overview | Prometheus . The PrometheusUDR type can be viewed in the UDR Internal Format Browser . The PrometheusUDR contains data that can be sent to the endpoints running on each Execution Context. The following fields are included in the PrometheusUDR : Field/Option Description Name (string) This field is populated with the metric name, for example mim_realtime_processing_analysis_outbound_udrs . MetricType (string) This field is populated with one of the metric types supported by Prometheus. Supported types are: COUNTER GAUGE UNTYPED (default) Value (double) This field is populated with a numeric value and is what, in most cases, is displayed in your Grafana graph. For example, the field can be populated by 6.5 . Labels (map<string.string>) This field is populated with the labels applied to the metric, for example, origin_country . Description (string) This field is populated with a description of a metric.",
