    "text": "The ECS Maintenance system task removes outdated ECS data, provided that the state is Reprocessed . The number of days to keep data is set in the ECS Maintenance configuration dialog (see ECS Maintenance System Task Configuration ). It is also possible to fully turn off the cleanup of UDRs, Batches, Statistics, or all of them. The Statistics can be reported by email. This is configured in the Report tab of the task. When the ECS Maintenance System Task is executed, several things happen: UDRs, batches, and ECS statistics are removed from the ECS according to the settings in the Cleanup tab. See Cleanup Tab in ECS Maintenance System Task Configuration . An ECS Statistics Event is generated containing information about the number of UDRs associated with every error code. This occurs at time intervals configured in the ECS Maintenance System Task Configuration . See ECS Statistics Event for further information about how to configure notifications for the ECS Statistics Event. Statistical information is sent to the ECS Statistics, according to what is configured in the Report Tab in ECS Maintenance System Task Configuration . An email containing statistical information is sent to the email recipient specified in the Report Tab in ECS Maintenance System Task Configuration . For further information on how to configure the mail server and port, see Platform in the System Administrator's Guide. Note! The ECS is designed to store a fairly limited amount of erroneous UDRs and batches. It is therefore important that the data is extracted, reprocessed, or deleted from the ECS regularly.
