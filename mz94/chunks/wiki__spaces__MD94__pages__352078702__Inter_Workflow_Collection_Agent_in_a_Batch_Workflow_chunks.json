    "text": "To open the Inter Workflow collection agent configuration, click Configuration  New Configuration . Select Workflow from the Configurations dialog. When prompted to select a workflow type, click Batch . Click Add agent and select Inter Workflow from the Agent Selection dialog. Double-click the agent icon or right-click the icon and select Edit agent , to display the Agent Configuration dialog. Open Setting Description Setting Description Profile The name and most recent version of the Inter Workflow profile. All workflows in the same workflow configuration can use separate Inter Workflow profiles, if that is preferred. In order to do that the profile must be set to Default in the Workflow Table tab found in the Workflow Properties dialog. After that each workflow in the table can be appointed different profiles. Deactivate on Idle If enabled, the agent will deactivate the workflow if it has no more batches to collect. Note! Make sure a proper scheduling criteria is defined for a workflow with this feature turned on, since the agent will cause the workflow to deactivate immediately if no data is available. Note! When you use the Inter Workflow collection agent with a Local Archiving agent, if you want outdated files to be cleaned up, you must select this check box. No Merge If enabled, each incoming batch will generate one outgoing batch. Merge Batches Based on Criteria If enabled, decides if the incoming batches will be merged into larger entities, as soon as any of the merge criteria defined in the Merge Definition, are met. Note! It is not possible to import MIM values for all batches in a merge; header MIMs for the first batch will be selectable, as well as trailer and batch MIMs for the last batch. Merge All Available Batches If enabled, all incoming batches will be inserted into one outgoing batch. Age of Oldest Batch (sec) Indicates for how long (in seconds) the agent will wait after the first incoming batch. When this time has expired, an outgoing batch will be produced, regardless if the Number of Bytes/Batches criteria has been fulfilled or not. Number of Batches The number of incoming batches to merge. Number of Bytes The size of the batches produced by the collection agent. The incoming files are never split. For instance, if 300 is entered and the source files are 200 bytes each, the produced batches will be 400 bytes. Use Custom Stream Select this checkbox to enable Stream ID-based connections across multiple workflows using the same profile. When checked, collector and forwarding agents establish connections based on both the profile and a Stream ID, allowing workflows to link dynamically. In cases where a real-time workflow connects to a batch workflow, they scale as a unit, ensuring backend/frontend pairs stay linked via the Stream ID. Note! If this checkbox is cleared, the Inter Workflow profile is fixed at design time and cannot be changed dynamically, preventing chained workflows from scaling. Example - Configuring a Stream ID in Inter Workflow Forwarder and Collection Agents Scenario: You have multiple processing workflows that each need to send data to a specific collection workflow. Instead of creating separate Inter Workflow profiles for each pair, you can configure a stream ID to manage these connections within a single profile. For example, if three processing workflows (A, B, and C) need to send data to three corresponding collection workflows (X, Y, and Z), you can define stream IDs like \"A-X\", \"B-Y\", and \"C-Z\". This ensures each processing workflow sends data to the correct collection workflow while maintaining a simpler, more scalable configuration. Stream ID If you have checked the Use Custom Stream checkbox add a Stream ID.",
