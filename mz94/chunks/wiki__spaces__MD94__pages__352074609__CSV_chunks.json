    "text": "This section contains information that is specific to the database type CSV, which can be used for reading data from a CSV file instead of reading from a database. Supported Functions The CSV database can be used with: Database Table Related Functions (APL) Shared Table Profile The CSV files need to be in a separate folder. Since the CSV type only reads from files, no additional preparations are required. Note! When using a CSV database profile in a Shared Table configuration, you have to configure the properties for this using Advanced Connection Setup if you want to use any of the table storage options On Heap , Off Heap , Unsafe , or Primitive Lookup . When properties have not been configured for this, only the Object option will be available. Properties When selecting the CSV database type, you can configure all properties described on the page http://csvjdbc.sourceforge.net/doc.html in the section section \"Driver Properties\" using the Properties tab in the Database profile. Preparations No specific preparations are required for using the CSV database type.",
