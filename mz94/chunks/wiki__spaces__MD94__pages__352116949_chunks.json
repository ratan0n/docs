You can use regular expressions in the Conditional Trace templates, but be careful of overusing \" .*\" . The more specific the filter is, the better the result you will get in terms of minimized amount of output and performance impact. You can create templates for any real-time workflows, giving you results for all agents in the workflow, and you can also use the trace() APL function in Analysis or Aggregation agents to get results for specific functions in the APL code.
